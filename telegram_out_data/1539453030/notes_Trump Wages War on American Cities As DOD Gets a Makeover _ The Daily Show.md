  - Pete Hegseth provides an explanation for the new name, focusing on a more aggressive and less "politically correct" military.
  - His statements use strong, evocative language to emphasize a shift towards "maximum lethality" and away from perceived softness.

  - "Maximum lethality, not tepid legality."
  - "Violent effect, not politically correct."

### 6.0 Proposed Renaming of the Pentagon
#### 6.1 Intro to Topic
  - To align with the new aggressive "Department of War" theme, a humorous suggestion is made to rename the Pentagon.
  - The current name is deemed not intimidating enough.

#### 6.2 Lack of Intimidation from "Pentagon"
  - "Pentagon" is described as "just a pretentious square."
  - It is suggested that the name does not inspire fear.

#### 6.3 Alternative Names
  - The "Polygon of Doom."
  - The "Anus of Destruction."

### 7.0 Official Status of the Name Change
#### 7.1 Intro to Topic
  - Despite the announcement, the name change to "Department of War" is not legally official.
  - The executive order instead designates it as a secondary name, essentially a nickname.

#### 7.2 Legal Requirements for Name Change
  - Officially changing the name of the Department of Defense requires an act of Congress.
  - It also requires 60 votes in the Senate, which Trump could not secure.

#### 7.3 "Secondary Name" Status
  - The executive order makes "Department of War" a secondary name.
  - This is likened to the American military giving itself an official nickname.
  - This move is sarcastically described as making the military seem weaker, similar to someone trying to create their own nickname like "Stevie Muscles."

### 8.0 Financial Cost of the Name Change
#### 8.1 Intro to Topic
  - The unofficial name change, or creation of a "nickname," is projected to incur significant costs.
  - This expenditure is seen as a waste, especially given other areas where funding has been cut.

#### 8.2 Estimated Cost
  - According to Politico, it will likely cost billions of dollars.
  - This cost is for changing stationery, emblems, plaques, and other signage at the Defense Department and bases worldwide.

#### 8.3 Critique of Spending Priorities
  - The billions spent on a "nickname" are contrasted with cuts to cancer research and food safety.
  - The money could have been spent on fighter jets for other countries, which might then be used against each other.

### 9.0 Deployment of the Department of War

  - The newly aggressive "Department of War" is not primarily targeting foreign adversaries.
  - Instead, there are plans to deploy troops to American cities, particularly those with Democratic leadership.

#### 9.2 Target Locations
  - Planning is underway to potentially send troops into Chicago.
  - New York is also mentioned as a target for help.

#### 9.3 Trump's Rhetoric
  - Trump shared a manipulated image with a twist on a quote from "Apocalypse Now."
  - The caption read: "I love the smell of deportations in the morning" and "Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of War."
  - The first use of the "Department of War" is framed as invading American cities.
  - Invading New York, Trump's home city, is humorously labeled as "Freudian."

### 10.0 Trump's Test Case in Washington D.C.
#### 10.1 Intro to Topic
  - Washington D.C. served as a test case for Trump's strategy of deploying the National Guard to American cities.
  - Trump attempted to portray the deployment as a success by appearing in public.

#### 10.2 National Guard Deployment
  - The National Guard was sent into Washington D.C. a month prior.
  - Trump aimed to demonstrate that the city was safe.

#### 10.3 Trump's Public Appearance
  - Trump went out for dinner with cabinet members in D.C.
  - He claimed restaurants were "booming" and people were "going out to dinner where they didn't go out for years."
  - He thanked the National Guard for making the city safe.

#### 10.4 Critique of Trump's "Safety" Display
  - His display of safety involved driving one block from the White House.
  - He was surrounded by a fleet of armored cars and countless Secret Service agents.
  - His entourage is humorously described as a "pussy posse" or "the bachelor party from hell."

#### 10.5 Protests During Dinner
  - Despite Trump's claims of safety, he faced protests while dining.
  - Protesters chanted "Free DC!", "Free Palestine!", and "Trump is the Hitler of our time."
  - This is humorously suggested as a way to get out of paying a restaurant bill.

### 11.0 Interview with Josh Johnson on the Department of War
#### 11.1 Intro to Topic
  - Josh Johnson provides a comedic and exaggerated perspective on the Department of War.
  - He emphasizes aggressive posturing and selective targeting, revealing the absurdities of the new approach.

#### 11.2 Aggressive Stance
  - Johnson asserts that the "Department of War" signals that Donald Trump "isn't f***ing around."
  - He adopts a "B-boy stance" to convey readiness for war.

#### 11.3 Selective Enemies
  - The Department of War is ready to fight "anybody, any time."
  - However, China is explicitly excluded due to their military strength and "inventing kung fu."
  - Preferred targets include "hotel workers in Baltimore" and "cleaning ladies" who "had it too good for too long."
  - Sinaloa Cartel is also explicitly excluded due to their brutality.
  - Unarmed boats are considered acceptable targets from a distance.

#### 11.4 "Jailhouse Strategy" for War
  - Johnson shares a twisted "jailhouse strategy" for maintaining peace through strength.
  - Instead of punching the biggest guy, one should "start beating the s*** out of yourself."
  - This is illustrated by punching one's own testicles, as "no one's going to mess with him. He crazy."
  - He quotes Pete Hegseth: "You got to have the guts to cut your own nuts."

#### 11.5 Conclusion of Interview
  - Kosta calls Trump's plan "one of the dumbest things I've ever heard."
  - Johnson escalates the interaction, leading to him punching himself in the groin to demonstrate his "peace through strength" strategy.
