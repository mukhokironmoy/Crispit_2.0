0:00:00 : Since taking
office, Donald Trump
0:00:01 : has been spending a lot
of time redecorating,
0:00:04 : from paving over
the Rose Garden
0:00:06 : to turning the Oval Office into
a Cash for Gold storefront.
0:00:10 : But now that the White
House is perfect,
0:00:12 : Trump has moved
on to renovating
0:00:14 : the Department of Defense.
0:00:16 : REPORTER: President
Trump has just
0:00:17 : signed an executive
order to rename
0:00:19 : the Department of Defense.
0:00:20 : The president wants
to change the name
0:00:22 : back to the Department of War.
0:00:24 : Hmm.
0:00:25 : Um, not a good sign when
a country that's not at war
0:00:29 : suddenly sets up
a Department of War.
0:00:32 : [LAUGHTER]
0:00:33 : What's the president
trying to tell us
0:00:35 : about what's going to happen?
0:00:37 : It's like when your doctor
asks you to come in and discuss
0:00:39 : your test results in person.
0:00:41 : Uh, why?
0:00:43 : So we can high five over
how few STDs I have?
0:00:48 : [LAUGHTER]
0:00:51 : So why is Trump doing this?
0:00:54 : We won the first World War.
0:00:55 : We won the Second World War.
0:00:57 : We won everything before
that and in between.
0:01:00 : And then we decided to go
woke and we changed the name
0:01:02 : to Department of Defense
0:01:04 : Oh, oh, yeah.
0:01:06 : So the military went
woke when they changed
0:01:09 : their name in 1947,
that famously woke time
0:01:13 : period in American history.
0:01:15 : [LAUGHTER]
0:01:17 : I guess wokeness is also
why we lost in Vietnam, huh?
0:01:20 : Big mistake to carpet bomb
that country with DVDs
0:01:23 : of the Black Little Mermaid.
0:01:25 : [LAUGHTER]
0:01:29 : But OK, the new
name is supposed
0:01:31 : to reflect that our military
is no longer woke.
0:01:34 : What does that mean exactly?
0:01:36 : Pete Hegseth,
could you tell us?
0:01:37 : Hey, but make it funky.
0:01:39 : We're going to go on offense,
not just on defense.
0:01:42 : Maximum lethality,
not tepid legality.
0:01:46 : Violent effect, not
politically correct.
0:01:50 : [LAUGHTER]
0:01:53 : Deadly force, not
a gender studies course.
0:01:56 : [LAUGHTER]
0:01:58 : It's World War III,
not Adam and Steve.
0:02:01 : [LAUGHTER]
0:02:02 : Agent Orange not-- ah, [BLEEP],
I wrote myself into a corner.
0:02:07 : [LAUGHTER]
0:02:08 : But yeah, slam poetry.
0:02:10 : Great.
0:02:11 : In his sobriety, Edgar
Allen Bro over here
0:02:14 : picked up the one hobby that's
actually worse than drinking.
0:02:17 : [LAUGHTER]
0:02:19 : By the way, if the vibe we're
going for is maximum lethality,
0:02:22 : we should probably also
think about changing
0:02:24 : the name of the Pentagon.
0:02:26 : That name's not scaring anyone.
0:02:28 : Pentagon?
0:02:29 : That's just
a pretentious square.
0:02:31 : [LAUGHTER]
0:02:32 : You want the world
quivering in their boots?
0:02:35 : From now on, it should
be (IN DEEP VOICE)
0:02:38 : the Polygon of Doom.
0:02:41 : [CHEERING]
0:02:47 : (IN REGULAR VOICE) So, yes,
the Department of Defense
0:02:50 : is now officially
the Department of War, except--
0:02:53 : funny thing-- it's
not really, literally,
0:02:56 : officially, actually.
0:02:58 : To be clear,
officially changing
0:02:59 : the name of the Department
of Defense
0:03:01 : would require an act
of Congress and 60 votes
0:03:03 : in the Senate, which
Trump could not get.
0:03:05 : REPORTER: It appears that this
executive order is not really
0:03:08 : changing the name completely
from DoD, Department
0:03:10 : of Defense,
to Department of War,
0:03:12 : but is instead making
it a secondary name.
0:03:16 : [LAUGHTER]
0:03:18 : Secondary name?
0:03:20 : Are you telling me
the American military just gave
0:03:22 : itself an official nickname?
0:03:25 : If anything, that
makes it seem weaker.
0:03:27 : There's nothing more pathetic
than that friend that tries
0:03:30 : to create his own nickname.
0:03:31 : From now on, call
me Stevie Muscles.
0:03:33 : OK.
0:03:34 : That's cute, Stevie Muscles.
0:03:36 : But your mom's here
to pick you up.
0:03:37 : [LAUGHTER]
0:03:39 : But what's the harm, right?
0:03:41 : It's not going
to cost us anything.
0:03:42 : Right?
0:03:43 : [LAUGHTER]
0:03:45 : Right?
0:03:46 : [LAUGHTER]
0:03:47 : Right?
0:03:50 : REPORTER: According
to Politico,
0:03:51 : it will likely cost
billions of dollars
0:03:53 : to change the name on
stationery, emblems, plaques,
0:03:56 : and other signage at the
Defense Department and bases
0:03:59 : around the world.
0:04:01 : Billions?
0:04:03 : It's going to cost billions
to adopt this not even name,
0:04:06 : but nickname?
0:04:07 : My God, what a waste.
0:04:08 : You know, and that's
real money that we
0:04:10 : could have spent on two
fighter jets for Qatar that
0:04:13 : would get bombed by two other
fighter jets from Israel
0:04:16 : that we also paid for.
0:04:17 : But OK, this is
the same administration
0:04:19 : that DOGE'd the [BLEEP]
out of cancer
0:04:21 : research and food safety.
0:04:23 : But they can find billions
to change the stationery
0:04:26 : at the Pentagon?
0:04:27 : Oh, sorry, not the Pentagon.
0:04:29 : (IN DEEP VOICE)
The Anus of Destruction.
0:04:31 : [CHEERING]
0:04:37 : (IN REGULAR VOICE)
But you know what?
0:04:39 : That's-- thank God
for that effect.
0:04:40 : But you know what?
0:04:41 : That's cool.
0:04:42 : We got the Department
of War now,
0:04:44 : and they'll be terrifying
America's enemies
0:04:46 : wherever they go.
0:04:48 : Where exactly are they going?
0:04:50 : REPORTER: Planning is
underway to potentially
0:04:52 : duplicate Trump's
mobilization in DC
0:04:55 : and send troops into Chicago.
0:04:58 : I think Chicago
will be our next.
0:04:59 : And then we'll
help with New York.
0:05:02 : REPORTER: Trump sharing
a manipulated image
0:05:04 : of himself with a twist on a
quote from the movie Apocalypse
0:05:07 : Now.
0:05:08 : The caption says, "I love
the smell of deportations
0:05:11 : in the morning"
and the line "Chicago
0:05:14 : about to find out why it's
called the Department of War."
0:05:17 : So great.
0:05:18 : The first use of our new
Department of War
0:05:20 : is invading American cities.
0:05:22 : And by the way, if Trump
does send troops
0:05:24 : to New York, that means he's
going to invade the very city
0:05:27 : he came out of.
0:05:29 : Hmm.
0:05:30 : Freudian much?
0:05:31 : [LAUGHTER]
0:05:32 : Just admit that you want
to [BLEEP] your mom, dude.
0:05:35 : All right?
0:05:36 : But before he invades
all Democratic cities,
0:05:39 : Trump first used Washington,
DC as a test case.
0:05:42 : It's been a month since
Trump sent the National Guard
0:05:44 : into the nation's capital.
0:05:45 : And last night, Trump
tried to show everyone
0:05:47 : that it's been a yuge success.
0:05:50 : Fox News alert, Donald
Trump is out on the town--
0:05:53 : dinner with members of his
cabinet in DC, showing it's
0:05:56 : safe to walk around
the city after deploying
0:05:58 : the National Guard.
0:05:59 : The restaurants
now are booming.
0:06:01 : People are going
out to dinner, where
0:06:03 : they didn't go out for years.
0:06:04 : And it's a safe city.
0:06:06 : And I just want to thank
the National Guard.
0:06:08 : Hey, nothing says I
feel safe like driving
0:06:12 : one block from the White
House, surrounded
0:06:14 : by a fleet of armored cars
and countless Secret
0:06:16 : Service agents.
0:06:17 : [CHEERING]
0:06:24 : And just look at this pussy
posse behind him, huh?
0:06:29 : That looks like the bachelor
party from hell.
0:06:32 : You got the jokester,
right, the bad boy,
0:06:36 : the guy who has
work in the morning
0:06:38 : and doesn't want to be
in this friend group anymore
0:06:40 : and ends up crying
through a lap dance.
0:06:43 : [LAUGHTER]
0:06:45 : Whatever you think about
the occupation of DC, at least
0:06:48 : Trump now feels safe
enough to go out.
0:06:49 : And he can enjoy
a nice meal in peace.
0:06:52 : REPORTER: Overnight,
while dining
0:06:53 : out in Washington,
DC, President Trump
0:06:55 : facing protests.
0:07:08 : PROTESTORS: Free DC!
0:07:09 : Free Palestine!
0:07:10 : Trump is the Hitler
of our time.
0:07:13 : Yeah.
0:07:14 : Give it up for the protesters.
You know what I mean?
0:07:16 : Here we go.
So--
0:07:17 : [CHEERING]
0:07:20 : Also, they just
discovered the most
0:07:22 : genius way of getting out
of your restaurant bill, right?
0:07:26 : $40 for a shrimp cocktail?
0:07:28 : Um, uh, Trump's Hitler.
0:07:30 : Trump's-- oh, no.
0:07:31 : Don't kick me out.
0:07:32 : We didn't settle our tab.
0:07:33 : OK, see ya.
0:07:34 : Bye.
0:07:36 : I'm going to do that next
time I go to Panera Bread.
0:07:37 : [LAUGHTER]
0:07:39 : I sympathize with these people.
0:07:41 : I protest in steakhouses
all the time, specifically,
0:07:44 : Ruth's Chris steakhouse.
0:07:46 : What the [BLEEP]
does that mean?
0:07:48 : [LAUGHTER]
0:07:50 : Who is Chris?
0:07:51 : Why is he Ruth's?
0:07:54 : [LAUGHTER]
0:07:57 : For more on the new
Department of War,
0:07:59 : we go live to the Pentagon
with Josh Johnson.
0:08:02 : [CHEERING]
0:08:04 : Yeah.
0:08:05 : Josh.
0:08:06 : [CHEERING]
0:08:09 : Josh, this name change feels
like a real waste of time
0:08:13 : to me.
0:08:14 : That's because you're
a bitch, Kosta.
0:08:16 : [LAUGHTER]
0:08:18 : Department of War
is letting everybody
0:08:20 : know that Donald Trump
isn't [BLEEP] around.
0:08:23 : It's like Pete Hegseth says.
0:08:24 : We're the Department of War.
0:08:26 : We're here to say, we do
all the war in a major way.
0:08:29 : B-boy stance.
0:08:30 : What?
0:08:31 : [CHEERING]
0:08:34 : So you're saying America is on
war footing, ready to fight any
0:08:37 : of our enemies at any time.
0:08:40 : Anybody, any time.
0:08:43 : Including China?
0:08:44 : Hell, no,
obviously not China.
0:08:47 : They got tanks and--
0:08:48 : they invented kung fu, Kosta.
0:08:51 : No, I'm talking about
hotel workers in Baltimore.
0:08:54 : These cleaning ladies had
it too good for too long.
0:08:58 : Cleaning ladies?
0:08:59 : Aren't there more
appropriate enemies
0:09:00 : for the Department of War,
like the Sinaloa Cartel?
0:09:04 : [BLEEP] no, dude,
those guys chop
0:09:06 : people's heads off for fun.
0:09:08 : No, no, no, we're
not touching cartels.
0:09:10 : But an unarmed boat, we light
that shit up, from a distance.
0:09:14 : All right?
0:09:15 : Bombs away.
0:09:16 : We ain't here to play.
0:09:17 : Poison.
0:09:20 : Poison?
0:09:21 : [CHEERING]
0:09:23 : So, to be clear,
the Department of War
0:09:25 : isn't trying to do war,
just little skirmishes?
0:09:28 : I can tell you
never been to jail.
0:09:30 : [LAUGHTER]
0:09:31 : No.
0:09:32 : No, I-- have you?
0:09:34 : That's not the point.
0:09:35 : You know-- you know how
they say, in jail, you
0:09:38 : should walk right up
to the biggest guy
0:09:40 : and punch him in the face?
0:09:41 : That's not true
at all, all right?
0:09:42 : What you should
actually do is walk
0:09:44 : in and start beating the shit
out of yourself, all right?
0:09:48 : You ever see a guy
punching his own balls?
0:09:50 : No one's going
to mess with him.
0:09:51 : He crazy.
0:09:52 : [LAUGHTER]
0:09:54 : It's just like
Pete Hegseth says.
0:09:56 : You got to have the guts
to cut your own nuts.
0:09:59 : Stop.
0:10:00 : Hammer time.
0:10:01 : [CHEERING]
0:10:04 : I'm no expert.
0:10:05 : But Trump's plan of laying
siege to his own country
0:10:08 : may be one of the dumbest
things I've ever heard.
0:10:10 : Them's fighting words, Kosta.
0:10:12 : You want to go?
0:10:14 : Yeah.
Yeah, you know what?
0:10:15 : Yeah.
Let's go.
0:10:16 : Let's go.
- Yeah.
0:10:17 : Well, I'm on the way.
0:10:19 : Right now, let's go.
0:10:20 : Let's go.
- All right.
0:10:21 : You asked for it.
0:10:23 : Oh my god.
0:10:24 : [GRUNTING]
0:10:25 : He's punching
himself in the nuts.
0:10:27 : Oh, yeah.
0:10:28 : You had enough yet, Kosta?
0:10:29 : Fine, fine, fine.
I yield.
0:10:30 : Just stop.
Just stop.
0:10:31 : Just stop.
0:10:32 : See?
0:10:33 : [COUGHING] Peace
through strength, Kosta.
0:10:36 : Josh Johnson, everyone.
