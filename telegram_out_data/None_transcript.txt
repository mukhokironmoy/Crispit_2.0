0:00:05 : What makes a leader worth following?
0:00:08 : Is it rank, recognition,
the ability to inspire, or simply showing
0:00:13 : up first when it matters the most?
0:00:15 : In this special episode of Rebooting
the Brain, Dr. Sharan Srinivasan is joined
0:00:19 : by retired Major General Ravi Murugan,
decorated with the Param Vishishta Seva
0:00:24 : Medal and the Ati Vaishishta Seva Medal,
among the highest military honours
0:00:29 : for distinguished service to the nation.
0:00:31 : From the icy altitudes of Siachen,
the world's highest battlefield,
0:00:35 : to the volatile front lines of the Line
of Control, from leading combat patrols
0:00:39 : under fire to shaping leadership
within the army and beyond.
0:00:43 : Major General Murugan's life is
not just the story of gallantry.
0:00:46 : It's a blueprint for integrity,
discipline, and thinking under pressure.
0:00:51 : He believes the army is not about war,
it's about people,
0:00:54 : about values passed down through silence
and sweat, about leading from the front,
0:00:59 : whether you're at 19,000 feet
in the combat gear or in a Bangalore
0:01:03 : boardroom solving
for infrastructure and systems.
0:01:06 : This episode takes you across domains,
from combat zones to construction sites,
0:01:10 : from training soldiers to mentoring
civilians, from nation building
0:01:15 : to parenting, and from discipline as
habit to leadership as moral clarity.
0:01:20 : We dive into stories of soldiers risking
everything because they trust who's
0:01:25 : leading them, of battle-hardened platoons,
mountain patroles,
0:01:28 : and moments where seconds meant survival,
of fitness, not as a routine,
0:01:33 : but as a keystone habit that defines
readiness and culture,
0:01:37 : and of the difference between being
in charge and truly taking responsibility.
0:01:42 : Major General Murugan doesn't mince words.
0:01:45 : He challenges assumptions about
entitlement, shortcuts, work-life balance,
0:01:49 : and the way we are raising
the next generation.
0:01:51 : He calls for a deeper national
consciousness, where pride, ownership,
0:01:55 : and excellence are lived values,
not just campaign slogans.
0:02:00 : What does it mean to serve not just
in uniform, but as a citizen,
0:02:04 : a parent, a professional?
0:02:06 : What happens when you treat time,
systems, and people with intention?
0:02:11 : And what is the quiet power of showing up
again and again,
0:02:15 : even when no one is watching?
0:02:18 : This conversation is about ruthless
compassion, the kind that holds people
0:02:22 : to high standards without compromise,
yet never loses sight of humanity.
0:02:28 : This is rebooting the brain This episode
is a masterclass in leadership,
0:02:33 : ethos, and national responsibility.
0:02:35 : Regimentation primarily was a British
word during the first World War.
0:02:41 : The British lost
the flower of their youth.
0:02:44 : The casualties were extremely high because
the First World War was fought by
0:02:50 : two armies in trenches.
0:02:52 : It was that predictable that at the blow
of a whistle, one lot would get up,
0:02:58 : clamber over their trenches.
0:03:00 : Go across no man's land,
and attack the other ones who are
0:03:05 : coming inside the trenches.
0:03:08 : They were sitting ducks.
They were sitting.
0:03:10 : They would be beaten back and many
of them would die on the battlefield.
0:03:14 : Some would be wounded,
rest would straggle back.
0:03:17 : Then the other side
would do the same thing.
0:03:20 : It was foolishness.
0:03:22 : The casualties were extremely high.
0:04:21 : Rebooting the Brain,
0:04:28 : powered by PRS Neurosciences.
0:04:52 : Namaste, everybody.
0:04:59 : Welcome to yet another edition of the
Trending podcast, Rebooting the Brain.
0:05:05 : Before we start the show,
the customary prayer.
0:05:11 : Om.
0:05:40 : This sloka has been a big inspiration
and driver for me from many, many decades.
0:05:46 : As the Shloka says,
From darkness to light, from ignorance
0:05:51 : to the truth, and from death to mortality.
0:05:54 : I believe that you can use these messages
in any way, in any aspect of your life
0:06:01 : and seek your own answers,
seek your own way to become a better human
0:06:05 : being, a more productive
citizen of this country.
0:06:08 : Hi, everybody.
0:06:09 : My name is Dr. Sharan Srinivasan,
and I'm a Stereotactic and Functional
0:06:13 : Neurosurgeon from Bengaluru, India.
0:06:16 : Keeping up with our tradition of getting
some very eminent people beyond
0:06:21 : the podcast today,
we have an extraordinary gentleman here
0:06:24 : who's going to share his wisdom,
his views, and everything that he has gone
0:06:29 : through, his experience and otherwise,
which is extraordinary.
0:06:32 : He is a retired
Major General from the Army.
0:06:36 : Let me introduce you to the guest of the
show, Major General Retired, Ravi Murugan.
0:06:42 : Thank you.
Sir, welcome to our show.
0:06:44 : He's a highly decorated Army officer,
0:06:48 : PVSM, AVSM, and many other
0:06:52 : recognitions from the government.
0:06:53 : We will hear from him.
0:06:55 : For those of you who don't know
the expansion, PVSM is param
0:06:59 : Vishishta Seva Medal
which is the highest distinguished honour
0:07:03 : that the army gives in peace
time to any of their cader.
0:07:07 : Ati Vishishtha Seva Medal is AVSM.
0:07:09 : The video that you saw in the beginning
was him receiving the PVSM from none
0:07:15 : other than the President of India.
0:07:17 : Major General Saab, welcome to our show.
0:07:20 : Thank you for coming here.
Thank you so much.
0:07:23 : The introduction is very kind.
0:07:24 : Thank you so much, Dr. Sharan,
for having me here.
0:07:27 : My pleasure.
I really look forward to this interaction.
0:07:30 : Absolutely.
0:07:31 : We'll start with that moving video
that we saw of you receiving the medal.
0:07:37 : I am a brother-in-law who is also a
current serving Major General in the Army.
0:07:41 : I know what we go through as a family,
if you have an armed forces person there.
0:07:48 : We don't hear from him,
especially of what is going on.
0:07:52 : Tell us in brief of the PVSM and AVSM and
0:07:56 : what made the armed forces identify you
0:07:59 : as one of those distinguished officers.
0:08:02 : Well, the army is,
as most people know,
0:08:06 : it's the largest or maybe the second
largest organisation in the country.
0:08:10 : Railways may just be the largest.
0:08:14 : As I tell many people,
the army is not made up of people.
0:08:18 : The army is people.
Correct.
0:08:20 : The army stands for people.
Correct.
0:08:23 : Amongst people,
it's a hierarchical organisation, and you
0:08:29 : obviously You have leaders amongst them.
0:08:32 : You have an officer, Kader,
which leads from the front, and our
0:08:35 : army is extremely well known for that.
Absolutely.
0:08:38 : The army recognises.
0:08:41 : Everybody does their work.
0:08:43 : A lot of times It's a luck plays
into it that your work gets highlighted.
0:08:48 : But the army acknowledges contribution.
0:08:51 : Wherever there is organisational
contribution, wherever value is being
0:08:55 : added, the army recognises that.
0:08:58 : There are two kinds of awards.
0:09:01 : One is a gallantry award.
0:09:02 : Gallantry award is for a specific action.
0:09:06 : Let's say in combat, in operations,
an individual carries out an action which
0:09:12 : is above and beyond the call of duty.
0:09:14 : He gets awarded a gallantry
award for a specific act.
0:09:17 : Like the B Chakra.
Absolutely.
0:09:19 : The Chakra Series.
0:09:21 : Whether in peace time or war time,
you have the Chakra series,
0:09:24 : which are the gallantries.
Correct.
0:09:26 : Whereas the Distinguished Series Awards
are not for a It's a specific action.
0:09:30 : It is for a body of work.
Over a period of time.
0:09:33 : Over a period of time
in a specific appointment.
0:09:36 : The Ati Vishishtya Seva medal I got when I
was
0:09:40 : the general officer commanding
of a counterinsurgency
0:09:43 : force in Jammu and Kashmir.
0:09:45 : For that period, I served there.
0:09:47 : The army thought and
felt that the contributions were
0:09:54 : meritworthy, and they
awarded me the Ati Vishishtya Seva medal.
0:09:59 : And subsequent to that,
I was posted in the army headquarters
0:10:02 : in the military operations directorate.
0:10:04 : From there I came to Bangaluru as
the general officer commanding
0:10:08 : Karnataka and Kerala subarea.
0:10:10 : For that entire period,
acknowledging the effort and the work put
0:10:17 : in, the army probably felt that I merited
award of the Param Vishisht seva
0:10:21 : medal, and therefore I was awarded that.
0:10:23 : It is for the body of work and it is for
the perceived value which is
0:10:28 : being added in that organisation.
0:10:30 : I think that the summary that you gave
very clearly fits into the motto that you
0:10:35 : have given us, which is live with honour,
serve with courage, and lead by example.
0:10:39 : Probably the army identified
that you have done that and taken it.
0:10:44 : When we were chatting in multiple
occasions,
0:10:47 : I could see the glint in your eyes when
you spoke about leadership and how I could
0:10:53 : see that you are one of the leaders
who was dirtying his hands on the ground.
0:10:57 : You were right there.
0:10:58 : You're not sitting,
not in an air-conditioned room
0:11:00 : and directing somebody else.
0:11:03 : Let me start with a very
simple question to you.
0:11:06 : In your mind, what is your definition
of leadership or a good leader?
0:11:12 : No, that's a great question.
0:11:14 : It's a great question because it's
applicable not only for the army.
0:11:18 : It is applicable across all domains.
Absolutely.
0:11:21 : It just doesn't matter.
0:11:22 : You could be in private sector,
you could be leading a company of 10
0:11:25 : people or a thousand people,
you could be in government,
0:11:28 : you could be in the military,
you could be in But anywhere in the world.
0:11:31 : But leadership is essential.
Anywhere in the world.
0:11:32 : Anywhere.
Exactly.
0:11:33 : It's not an India-related
or country-related.
0:11:36 : If you ask me to give you a one-line
definition of leadership,
0:11:40 : this actually impacted me very profoundly.
0:11:43 : I read the present Pope, John Paul III.
I'm not sure.
0:11:48 : The present Pope,
I read one of his statements,
0:11:51 : and the statement was extremely profound.
0:11:55 : He said, Preach the gospel always.
0:11:59 : If necessary, talk.
0:12:01 : That is the essence of leadership.
0:12:05 : The essence of leadership is exemplary.
0:12:07 : It is by example.
0:12:09 : People follow what they see.
0:12:11 : People believe what they see.
0:12:13 : It is not what you say.
0:12:16 : You say something, you do something,
obviously, it's never going to be-
0:12:19 : The audio and video has to match.
Yeah, absolutely.
0:12:21 : The lesser you speak and the more you
demonstrate,
0:12:26 : that is exactly what resonates
with people, and they follow that.
0:12:30 : I'm happy to say I retired from the army,
life of uniform, after 37 years.
0:12:36 : 37 years?
0:12:37 : Yeah, and that doesn't include your
training period where
0:12:40 : you're also in uniform.
0:12:41 : Three years of NDA,
National Defence Academy,
0:12:43 : one year of Indian Military Academy.
More than 40 years?
0:12:46 : Yeah, 41 years actually, in some uniform.
0:12:50 : Indian army epitomises
this concept of leadership.
0:12:53 : Since the time we enter the army as young
commissioned officers, this has driven
0:13:00 : that it isn't enough
to say you will have to do.
0:13:04 : Right from the time when I joined,
I joined my battalion when we were in the
0:13:09 : mountains in Chushul at that time, 1987.
0:13:13 : I still remember that the first thing they
said is that you need to now be
0:13:18 : part of the group you're leading.
0:13:20 : For that, you have to do first,
and they will follow what you do.
0:13:25 : Correct.
0:13:25 : This exemplary to lead by example has
always been the ethos of the Indian Army.
0:13:30 : If you look at it, what
is the gold standard for measuring that?
0:13:36 : The gold standard for measuring that is
you have to compare the casualties
0:13:41 : whenever in operations of your
officers vis-a-vis the men.
0:13:46 : You will find that our casualties
of officers is extremely high.
0:13:50 : Why?
Because they're leading from front.
0:13:52 : Got it.
0:13:53 : If you're not leading from front,
you're not going to be a casualty.
0:13:58 : But when you compare it would
probably be the highest in the world.
0:14:02 : Really?
It should be.
0:14:04 : I'm giving you anecdotal figures.
0:14:07 : But if you look at it empirically also,
I'm sure it will bear out that
0:14:12 : it should be the highest in the world.
0:14:15 : Because for two reasons.
0:14:16 : One, I don't think
you have many armies which have the
0:14:19 : experience which we have in operations.
Real operations.
0:14:21 : Real operations.
0:14:21 : Not virtual operations
and not-Actual operations.
0:14:25 : Second, because of the ethos
wherein we lead from the front.
0:14:29 : From the front.
0:14:30 : Whereas in many other European armies,
to my mind,
0:14:33 : they follow a strictly
task-oriented concept.
0:14:38 : If my job is to be a
commander of a section,
0:14:44 : then I'm not going to go
with a smaller team.
0:14:46 : Or if my job is a company commander,
I will not go with a smaller team.
0:14:52 : We don't follow that.
0:14:53 : Wherever risks are high in the Indian
army, you would find
0:14:57 : that it is officer-led.
0:14:59 : I was always wondering, why would so
many officers lay down their lives?
0:15:04 : Because they lead from the front.
I never realised.
0:15:06 : You would see that even
in the Kargil conflict.
0:15:08 : That's exactly what it is.
0:15:09 : Even recently, we lost two officers.
0:15:11 : Even in asymmetric or let's say counter
Insurgency or counter-proxy war
0:15:18 : operations, you find those in J&K
anti-terrorist operations,
0:15:22 : you'll find that officer casualties are
high because they lead from the front.
0:15:26 : And axiomatically, when you lead from
the front, you are at the highest risk.
0:15:30 : True, absolutely.
0:15:31 : So come back to your question,
leadership is critical.
0:15:35 : And leadership is critical because
0:15:38 : it brings out the best in a cohort.
0:15:43 : Chief is in front of me.
Exactly.
0:15:44 : They can trust him to take
the decisions to make the right things.
0:15:47 : They have implicit faith.
0:15:48 : You're required to have faith.
Correct.
0:15:51 : The implicit faith which comes out of it,
that whether risky or
0:15:56 : not risky, he knows best.
0:16:00 : Our lives are in his hands because he's
demonstrating that he's
0:16:05 : putting his own life at risk.
0:16:06 : Those things are extremely critical.
0:16:09 : You're very right.
0:16:11 : So implicit faith comes because he's
put his life before their lives.
0:16:14 : Absolutely.
0:16:16 : What more validation do you want?
That's right.
0:16:20 : There are so many examples of this.
0:16:23 : My unit was an infantry unit before we got
converted to a mechanised infantry unit.
0:16:30 : Infantry is our foot soldiers and the
mechanised infantry is platform bound.
0:16:36 : Correct.
0:16:37 : I still remember you were deployed
at that time in one of the strife areas
0:16:42 : in the northeast, and I had how many,
I think, eight years service or so.
0:16:48 : I was, as usual, going in front
and that was a high risk area.
0:16:52 : I still remember
that the people who were behind me,
0:16:55 : these so-called scouts, they said that,
No, you need to move back.
0:16:58 : They are more bothered
Now, because they feel that you're
0:17:01 : putting yourself at unnecessary risk.
0:17:04 : They want to ask you to stop doing that.
0:17:06 : That shows that they have bought
in into this whole concept of being led.
0:17:12 : Now they are wanting
to protect the leadership.
0:17:16 : Those are things I think the Indian Army
epitomises the best in
0:17:21 : combat leadership, I think.
0:17:23 : That is my experience in this because I
speak from, of course,
0:17:27 : only the experience of the Indian Army and
some visibility into I'm a foreign armies.
0:17:30 : I had a United Nations mission in Angola,
and then subsequently, I was the
0:17:35 : defence attache in the United States.
0:17:37 : But this combat leadership,
I like that phrase because what I'm
0:17:43 : getting is like when I'm operating
on a very critical situation,
0:17:47 : I'm also in combat, literally,
trying to save that life.
0:17:51 : Yes, literally, the brain is
misbehaving, what do I do?
0:17:54 : I think, can you now take it one level
deeper and I mean,
0:18:01 : I'd love to hear from you and the viewers
would love to, combat
0:18:04 : leadership means what?
0:18:06 : Because I'm quite sure they can
extrapolate it in a crisis situation
0:18:10 : because combat means crisis
or a specific situation.
0:18:14 : Can you give us some wisdom on that?
0:18:17 : See,
by combat leadership,
0:18:19 : what I mean is now you have to make
decisions and take actions where
0:18:23 : there is something at stake.
0:18:25 : In the army parlance,
there are lives at stake.
0:18:30 : The lives could be- Or a land at stake.
No.
0:18:32 : By lives, I mean your own
lives or somebody else's lives.
0:18:35 : It could be collateral.
0:18:36 : It could be somebody- The public also.
0:18:39 : That is as far as within
the border counter insurgency goes.
0:18:45 : When you talk about conventional
operations, it is your own people's lives.
0:18:49 : The acme of a commander
is to protect the lives of his own people
0:18:54 : while achieving mission objectives.
0:18:56 : That is the acme of any good commander.
0:18:59 : A A combat leader obviously
cannot be a reckless person.
0:19:03 : A lot of people relate when I say
that lead from front is
0:19:06 : that they blindly charge forward.
It is not so.
0:19:08 : He has to be a thinking man.
0:19:09 : He has to reduce risks while taking those
which are acceptable risks
0:19:15 : in achieving mission objectives.
0:19:18 : He has to be, one, a logical person,
an intelligent man,
0:19:22 : a thinking person who's able to prepare
grounds wherein to give decisions.
0:19:28 : He does that well.
0:19:29 : Then now when he gives the decision,
now he has to show that whatever are
0:19:34 : the risks now there, he's party to that.
0:19:37 : In combat leadership, once you're
given directions or you're past your
0:19:42 : orders, you now have to follow
the same orders which you have passed.
0:19:47 : Putting yourself at the same risk
as you're putting the others in.
0:19:51 : Of course, that is
a simplistic way of putting it.
0:19:55 : But as you go higher and as you become
more senior, obviously,
0:19:59 : you are not It's not to be of a job
function is not to lead
0:20:02 : people into combat.
0:20:03 : You become more into the planning,
you're more into orchestrating strategy.
0:20:07 : Yeah, absolutely.
0:20:08 : The operational level
and the strategic level.
0:20:11 : But unless you are on the ground,
you can't Yeah, you want the context.
0:20:16 : The context is not known.
Absolutely.
0:20:17 : You become far more, what should I say,
immune to putting people at risk.
0:20:24 : You don't understand
the human element of it.
0:20:29 : Because I remember you You shared how you
went into your first posting in Siachen
0:20:34 : as a young officer, and you came
out two years later battle harder.
0:20:39 : Then that was the statement that you made.
0:20:42 : Actually, that moved me.
0:20:44 : Can you tell us what
made you make that statement?
0:20:47 : The year which…
0:20:49 : It is not that I went.
0:20:51 : I went as part of my unit.
0:20:53 : My unit moved to the Siachen glacier.
0:20:56 : As I said, the first
posting was in Chushul.
0:20:59 : From there, we moved into the glacier.
0:21:01 : For the viewers who do not know,
Siachen is the world's highest
0:21:05 : battleground in the most
inhospitable terrain.
0:21:08 : Absolutely.
0:21:10 : How much?
19,000 feet?
0:21:12 : Yeah, I mean, varying.
0:21:13 : You have from, say, 12,000
to maybe up to 20, 21,000.
0:21:17 : 21,000 feet in the Himalayas.
Exactly.
0:21:19 : More importantly, the environmental
conditions need to be known.
0:21:24 : That is, one, you are
an extremely treacherous terrain.
0:21:27 : This is completely glacier bound,
and with crevices, avalanches which occur
0:21:33 : on an extremely frequent basis.
That is number one.
0:21:35 : You're fighting the elements.
That is the first thing.
0:21:38 : You have oxygen content,
which is hardly 10% or 15%
0:21:42 : of that existing at the plane level.
0:21:46 : Taking a few steps is taxing.
0:21:50 : It affects your breath.
0:21:52 : You have to stop.
0:21:53 : It has so many other medical
connotations to this.
0:21:56 : It's all well documented.
0:22:00 : I wouldn't want to highlight the
environmental risks on it.
0:22:04 : But also- But you should just tell.
0:22:07 : It's not about highlighting.
0:22:08 : But see, environment is as important
for you to fight so many different things.
0:22:14 : What's going on here when you look
at that, you can't breathe
0:22:17 : and things like that.
0:22:18 : You're a human being
at the end of the day.
0:22:19 : You can't pretend that you're an army
officer, eliminate all the fear because
0:22:23 : obviously you have- You're
going to be affected.
0:22:25 : Yes.
Right.
0:22:26 : Your physical capacities get compromised,
compromised-And challenged.
0:22:30 : Radically.
0:22:31 : It's not only that,
even your thinking capacity,
0:22:34 : because as oxygen is lesser,
your ability to think through
0:22:38 : situations becomes problematic.
0:22:41 : Confusion is there, diet gets affected,
There are so many other aspects
0:22:46 : which compromise your ability to function
as you would function
0:22:49 : at a much lower altitude.
0:22:52 : Nearly your first posting.
0:22:53 : You are put in charge
of a group of people.
0:22:56 : I still remember I was in charge
of a platoon which is about 30-35 people.
0:23:02 : You have to now make those decisions
which are going to decide, one, the safety
0:23:08 : and security of that post itself.
0:23:10 : Because mind you, at that time,
it was an active line of control.
0:23:15 : What time?
Which year?
0:23:16 : We're talking about 1988.
0:23:18 : 1988 to 1990.
0:23:19 : That's when the militancy
was really- Not militant.
0:23:22 : This is with the- With the Pakistan?
Yeah.
0:23:24 : It's called the actual
ground position line.
0:23:27 : You have a line of control.
Okay.
0:23:30 : Then as you go into the glaciated terrain,
it's called the actual
0:23:34 : ground position line, AGPL.
0:23:37 : That was an active one.
0:23:41 : Exchange of fire used to be common place,
which is happening then.
0:23:46 : You said you could see them close by you.
0:23:48 : Yeah, because the posts are very close.
0:23:49 : How close is close?
0:23:51 : In the glacier, you would have,
let's say, 500 metres.
0:23:54 : You would have-Really?
Yeah.
0:23:55 : But on the line of control,
you will have much lesser.
0:23:58 : You would have 40 metres.
What?
0:24:00 : Yes, there are.
0:24:02 : Because these are
lines which have been demarcated.
0:24:07 : It's not a boundary.
Correct.
0:24:10 : So wherever you are in possession,
you put your post there so
0:24:14 : that you don't lose territory.
0:24:16 : So these positions are extremely close.
0:24:18 : In fact, in many posts,
you can hear conversations also
0:24:22 : which are happening across.
Some of them are that close.
0:24:25 : When you're made in charge of that,
you have to grow up extremely fast.
0:24:30 : I can imagine.
0:24:31 : The challenges are quite a bit,
but it's also a learning experience.
0:24:37 : My belief is that this experience
beats intelligence 10 times out of 10.
0:24:43 : You told me that.
I firmly believe that.
0:24:46 : Experience beats intelligence.
It's a given.
0:24:49 : When I'm put through that experience
at a relatively young age and relatively
0:24:55 : young service bracket,
I come out completely empowered because
0:25:02 : certain situations are not new to me then.
0:25:06 : I have been through
that familiarity process.
0:25:08 : I'm able to respond much faster rather
than being hesitant about what to do.
0:25:15 : The fastest-They're called
baptism by fire, as I say.
0:25:17 : So to say.
0:25:18 : It has not only been challenges,
but also how to manage people,
0:25:23 : how to lead people in these circumstances.
0:25:26 : Those things get driven
on because some things work.
0:25:28 : See, ultimately,
not only in the army, of course,
0:25:31 : a lot of things
will come to that regimened in terms
0:25:34 : of you follow anecdotal examples.
0:25:37 : You see somebody senior to you functioning
in a certain way,
0:25:40 : you automatically take lessons from that.
0:25:43 : Those examples are in front of you.
0:25:45 : You follow an anecdotal
form of leadership.
0:25:48 : But ultimately, it is only when you've
gone through that experience,
0:25:53 : are you able to form those matrix
of judgement in your mind,
0:25:58 : wherein you are able to respond
to It's a leadership situation.
0:26:01 : Three-dimensional or
five-dimensional is what you say.
0:26:04 : When you go into the surgeon and actually
see that, only then you know, oh,
0:26:07 : this is what it actually means.
0:26:08 : I can imagine.
I can see.
0:26:10 : I can draw parallels very quickly.
0:26:12 : My advice to the younger, and I I read,
by the way, Subroto Bagchi.
0:26:16 : I like the way he writes.
0:26:19 : The mind tree guy.
0:26:21 : You should see his blog post.
0:26:23 : One of the things I remember reading about
him and one of his articles
0:26:28 : in that he states this.
0:26:30 : This is for the generation, and it's
not even for the current generation.
0:26:33 : Let's say a generation before also,
he says the same thing because
0:26:37 : that is the vintage of that article.
0:26:39 : He said the problem is a lot of people
want to be parachuted into positions
0:26:43 : of authority and positions of influence.
0:26:47 : They don't want to get that,
the word you use, they don't want
0:26:49 : to get their hands dirty ground up.
0:26:52 : It is extremely necessary for especially
leadership positions, you have
0:26:56 : to get your hands dirty, ground up.
Absolutely.
0:27:00 : Absolutely.
I agree with you.
0:27:01 : You have to do the heavy lifting.
0:27:03 : You can't avoid the heavy lifting.
0:27:06 : The thought process in some of the newer
generation is that I don't
0:27:12 : need to go through this.
0:27:13 : I can circumvent it It
doesn't reach there.
0:27:15 : It doesn't happen.
0:27:16 : The entitled mentality
or whatever you call it.
0:27:19 : It is not meritworthy.
0:27:21 : It is not needed, but it is essential.
0:27:24 : There is no doubt about it.
It is essential.
0:27:27 : It's unless you go through,
and he says that very clearly, he says, We
0:27:31 : need people who can get their hands dirty.
0:27:33 : Once you get your hands dirty,
you know exactly what it involves.
0:27:37 : Now, when you are in a leadership
position, you make decisions
0:27:40 : from a position of information.
0:27:42 : You don't make positions from a decisions
from a position of assumptions.
0:27:48 : You assume so many things otherwise.
0:27:50 : I may assume things about your life
which I have no information about.
0:27:53 : Or you get fed the wrong information
and you make an action based on that.
0:27:57 : That is even worse.
He's even worse.
0:28:00 : As far as leadership goes,
this is extremely important.
0:28:02 : Again, I'm extremely happy that the army
follows that, again,
0:28:07 : as a matter of routine.
0:28:08 : We do that, again, through
this whole process of regimen.
0:28:11 : We follow this.
0:28:12 : We put a person through those situations
wherein he grows with that experience.
0:28:17 : You did mention
that you crossed a very treacherous
0:28:23 : path during your first posting.
Oh, that's right.
0:28:26 : Yes.
Tell us about that.
0:28:27 : I think that was quite inspiring.
0:28:29 : Of course, geographically,
we were in a place
0:28:33 : in the glacier, and then there is a path
which connects it to, subsequently,
0:28:38 : I'm talking about, as I said, 1988, '90.
0:28:42 : It connects to the Kargil sector
which came in the news during
0:28:47 : the Kargil war in 2000.
0:28:49 : There is a patrol which connects it.
0:28:52 : I still remember the past name.
0:28:54 : Of course, it was in the news
also during the Kargil war.
0:28:58 : I think Lieutenant, Hanifuddin.
0:29:00 : There's a Hanifuddin sector.
Correct.
0:29:02 : He's the one who gave up
his life at that time.
0:29:04 : But he protected the pass.
I remember that.
0:29:07 : Chorbat La is the past.
Yes, Chorbat La.
0:29:08 : I remember that.
0:29:09 : My patrol was the first one to go across
Chorbat La from the glaciated
0:29:13 : terrain to Kargill.
0:29:15 : At that time, Kargill
had a formation there.
0:29:20 : I still remember when I entered
the headquarters that the
0:29:23 : officer was so surprised.
0:29:24 : He said, Where have you come from?
0:29:26 : I said, From there.
0:29:27 : He says, No, there is no way
you could have come from there.
0:29:30 : But we made it.
0:29:31 : But the problem was,
as I told you at that time, we started
0:29:34 : with 30, and the terrain was so difficult.
0:29:37 : Only four of us managed
to finally cross the path.
0:29:39 : The rest had to go back because
they couldn't negotiate the path.
0:29:43 : But are you taught mountaineering skills
and all that as a part of going there?
0:29:46 : Yeah, that's right.
0:29:47 : You have orientation training
which happens for every battalion
0:29:51 : which enters the glacier.
0:29:52 : In fact, they call it a battle school.
0:29:56 : Certain people are nominated to attend
in Technical courses like
0:30:01 : in the Himalayan Mounteering Institute,
Nehru Institute of Mounteneering
0:30:05 : in Uttar Kashi.
I heard that.
0:30:06 : In these mountaineering schools,
you attend certain specialist courses.
0:30:10 : Before this,
I was sent to attend a mountaineering
0:30:14 : course in the Nehru Institute
of Mountaineering Uttarkashi.
0:30:17 : I did that, and definitely,
it's of great help.
0:30:20 : It gives you confidence, again,
that you are able to negotiate
0:30:26 : those mountain features or snow features
which who otherwise are daunting.
0:30:32 : I can see very early in your posting
that you're willing to take the risk,
0:30:37 : push the extra mile,
go where the unknown is, or at least not
0:30:41 : shy away, but everybody is going back.
0:30:43 : Should I also go back?
0:30:44 : Maybe I am being full hardly.
0:30:46 : Now, I think it reflects eventually
on the acknowledgement
0:30:48 : the army has given for you.
0:30:49 : It can't be an accident that the PVSM AVSM has
happened because of the fact that over
0:30:54 : time, you must have
consistently demonstrated this.
0:30:58 : But you said two very important
things in this whole thing.
0:31:01 : One is regimenation that we want
to come to, but getting the hands dirty.
0:31:06 : I want to make my own comment.
0:31:07 : Even today, if there's some problem,
I can roll my sleeve up and get
0:31:12 : the job done on the ground.
0:31:14 : Then the ground also watches
that he's no longer instructing.
0:31:17 : Exactly.
He's willing to do that.
0:31:19 : They get so much of confidence.
0:31:21 : You please be our own, we will do.
Absolutely.
0:31:23 : They just want that- Assurance.
0:31:25 : Assurance that if- That
you're participating.
0:31:27 : If something has happened,
I know he's there and he will back us up.
0:31:32 : I think that is very important.
0:31:33 : It also keeps our knife sharp.
0:31:35 : I tell my boys every time,
You have to keep your knife sharp.
0:31:39 : You have to be on the ground because
the ground is the one
0:31:43 : that gives us the information.
Absolutely.
0:31:46 : The ground sing songs that you will not
hear anywhere else that you have to hear.
0:31:50 : More importantly, see, it also
conveys the sentiment of ownership.
0:31:53 : When you start doing it,
you are owning that task and the job.
0:31:57 : It is not yours, it is ours.
0:32:00 : Exactly.
Well said.
0:32:01 : At once, unless you're a participator,
then your leadership function,
0:32:06 : you're not fulfilling to its optimal.
0:32:08 : You have to be a participator in these.
0:32:10 : You're absolutely right.
0:32:12 : As you said about yourself.
0:32:14 : Of Of course.
0:32:15 : See, the other, from a personal point
of view, I also feel why it is important
0:32:19 : is
there should be nothing which you are
0:32:23 : asking somebody to do in your domain
of specialisation which you
0:32:27 : can't do yourself.
0:32:28 : Because the day you If you're not able
to do something yourself, you are seeding
0:32:33 : ground from that leadership position.
0:32:35 : Because then somebody can say who's
whom you're leading, and this is primarily
0:32:40 : for the private sector also,
if he can't do this and I can do this,
0:32:45 : then why should he be in a position
wherein he's directing me,
0:32:48 : unless he's doing something
better in some other domain?
0:32:50 : Well said.
0:32:52 : You better be good- It can't
be a time-bound promotion.
0:32:54 : It has to be competence-bound.
0:32:56 : Yes, I think meritocracy and competence
should be the only way forward.
0:33:00 : I think that's the- Sports
is no better place to exemplify that
0:33:05 : because you deliver it, you are there.
Nobody cares.
0:33:09 : You can leapfrog so many
people and get there.
0:33:12 : Absolutely.
I think that's appropriate.
0:33:15 : It's not easy.
0:33:17 : This is the other thing which people,
again, for this new generation, I want.
0:33:20 : Not the new, I mean, I'm sorry,
I must be alienating the new generation.
0:33:24 : I'm talking about a lot
of a majority thought processes.
0:33:28 : Excellence is easy.
0:33:30 : That's a lot of people think it is easy.
It is not easy.
0:33:34 : It doesn't happen easily.
0:33:37 : It takes a lot of effort.
0:33:39 : It takes a lot of commitment.
0:33:41 : It takes a lot of practise.
0:33:43 : Unless you do all that,
you don't reach that standard.
0:33:46 : You will reach some video.
0:33:47 : See, I see it.
0:33:50 : I think I should take this opportunity
to one more message
0:33:53 : for the industry community.
0:33:55 : Now, Bangalore,
there is a lot of construction
0:33:57 : which is perpetually going on.
0:34:02 : Whenever you go to any of these houses, it
could be a very renowned builder also.
0:34:08 : Even if an expensive house
you go in, the finish is poor.
0:34:12 : You would find the slopes are not okay.
0:34:14 : The walls are not being
plastered uniformly.
0:34:17 : There would be issues in, let's say,
the plumbing is not straight.
0:34:21 : It shows a lack of,
what should I say, passion and a lack of
0:34:27 : standards in how you
deliver in that particular service.
0:34:32 : It is extremely important.
0:34:34 : It should not be that a Mason
should learn hands-on.
0:34:38 : There should be some a process wherein he
meets basic requirements,
0:34:43 : industry standards.
0:34:44 : All these, and my message in this is,
these big builders who are building
0:34:49 : everywhere, why don't they open a training
institute wherein they
0:34:54 : are training people?
0:34:55 : That will help in scaling India also
because not every job
0:34:58 : needs to be neurosurgeon.
Correct.
0:35:00 : They should open institutes wherein they
skill these hands-on tradesmen, a plumber,
0:35:06 : the mason, a carpenter, an electrician.
0:35:10 : The good ones get.
0:35:11 : It's hands-on.
0:35:13 : The accountability on these builders is
you will use them for five
0:35:18 : years in your projects.
0:35:19 : After that, based on this competence, he
can pick and choose where he wishes to go.
0:35:23 : But five years, you will use in your
project so that you train them well.
0:35:27 : The government needs to mandate it,
especially Actually, the big builders,
0:35:30 : they need to open these institutes.
0:35:32 : I hope somebody from the
government is listening.
0:35:34 : I think the major general saab is giving
a fantastic idea because I
0:35:39 : think there's no other escape to that.
0:35:40 : I think the IT industry did this finally
because the infosys and all,
0:35:44 : they have their own training institute
in Chennai, in Mysore, because they
0:35:47 : realised that they're not industry ready.
0:35:50 : I think that's the same way.
0:35:52 : I'll tell you one thing.
0:35:53 : I was in Japan for six months training
on the special burning surgeries I do
0:35:57 : in the brain called radio frequency
ablation, which is a Stereotactic
0:36:00 : and Functional Neurosurgeon Fellowship.
0:36:02 : I was at Tokyo Women's Medical University
in Tokyo, Japan, and I saw their attention
0:36:08 : to detail and their level of excellence.
0:36:10 : It is extraordinary.
0:36:12 : Extraordinary is having
travelled to different countries.
0:36:16 : I saw a level in the Japanese,
and for small things,
0:36:21 : not big things, every small thing.
0:36:23 : I had an Indian friend who had settled
in Japan, I connected there again and he
0:36:28 : said, Sharan, you think of any problem in
any field, Japanese would have solved it.
0:36:32 : However silly it is, however silly it is.
0:36:35 : It was so true.
0:36:37 : When I would meet Japanese there and I
would tell them I'm from India,
0:36:41 : they would tell me two things.
0:36:42 : Number one, Indians are very intelligent.
0:36:45 : They would say this.
Secondly, zero.
0:36:47 : We give zero to the world.
0:36:48 : This is the only place.
0:36:50 : First of all, when you said zero,
with limited English,
0:36:52 : I was wondering, what is the zero?
0:36:53 : Then somebody translate said, We,
Indians, give zero to the world.
0:36:57 : They acknowledge that.
0:36:58 : That's when I realised
that we are a great race.
0:37:01 : The reason we are not ruling
the world is because of mediocracy.
0:37:08 : We are tolerating mediocracy.
Absolutely.
0:37:11 : Secondly, this and poor work ethic.
0:37:15 : I think, Major General Saab,
if we can change these two, three,
0:37:19 : we will rule the world.
0:37:21 : I can hear it clearly from you.
0:37:23 : That comes from the point
of regimentation.
0:37:26 : That's what you said very clearly.
0:37:28 : In fact, the day Actually,
I heard that word regimmentation,
0:37:31 : and I learned it from you.
0:37:32 : I spoke to our CEO and I said,
We need to look at this very seriously
0:37:36 : because we were talking about
the company's code of honour and this
0:37:40 : and that, but we didn't get the right
phrase to actually put it in place.
0:37:44 : For the sake of a global audience,
can you really tell us...
0:37:49 : Regimmentation sounds like a very strict
0:37:52 : word or authoritative word rather
0:37:56 : than in this democracy and freedom.
0:37:58 : Please educate Our people on this.
0:38:01 : Regimentation primarily was a British
word during the First World War.
0:38:08 : The British lost
the flower of their youth.
0:38:11 : The casualties were extremely high because
the First World War was fought by
0:38:17 : two armies in trenches.
0:38:19 : It was that predictable that at the blow
of a whistle, one lot would get up,
0:38:25 : clamber over their trenches,
go across no man's land,
0:38:30 : and attack the other ones who are coming
from the out of the trenches,
0:38:33 : who are inside the trenches.
0:38:35 : They were sitting ducks.
They were sitting.
0:38:37 : They would be beaten back, and many
of them would die on the battlefield.
0:38:41 : Some would be wounded,
rest would straggle back.
0:38:44 : Then the other side
would do the same thing.
0:38:47 : It was foolishness.
0:38:49 : The casualties were extremely high.
0:38:52 : But the reason why régimentation gets
talked about there is, at that time,
0:38:57 : what the British had to do is they had
to people from all corners of the country.
0:39:02 : It could be from a town, it could be
from a rural area, from a village.
0:39:06 : They do not have the same
operating principles.
0:39:08 : They come from different backgrounds,
different upbringing.
0:39:11 : They had to bring them all together.
0:39:13 : One common minimum platform.
0:39:15 : That tomorrow when the whistle blows, that
everybody gets up and everybody attacks.
0:39:20 : For that, you have to have
a common operating platform.
0:39:24 : So your codes have to be the same.
0:39:27 : If my code is that I should not let...
0:39:29 : I Hypothetically, that I should not cheat,
I should not lie, I should stand for what
0:39:34 : is right, everybody has to do that.
0:39:36 : There has to be an immersive process.
0:39:39 : The cultural environment,
the operating environment,
0:39:43 : should put a young entrant through
an immersive process
0:39:46 : which then orients him to follow
that organisational ethos
0:39:51 : and ethics that the army does well.
0:39:55 : We have regimens within,
let's take the example of Infantry.
0:40:00 : You may have the Rajputh Regiment.
0:40:01 : I come from the Brigade of Guards,
which is a separate regimen by itself.
0:40:04 : You have the Madras Regiment.
0:40:06 : You could have the Dhaugra.
0:40:07 : But everybody follows a process
of regimentation,
0:40:10 : wherein every new recruit,
whether it be an officer,
0:40:13 : whether it be a javan, When he comes in,
he's put through a system of life wherein
0:40:19 : he realises this is the unit ethos,
which is a subset of the army ethos.
0:40:25 : The expectation is that he will do this
when the time comes for him to deliver.
0:40:31 : Based on that and when that expectation
seeps into him, he does exactly
0:40:35 : what- Gets into the DNA.
Absolutely.
0:40:37 : It gets into his DNA.
He gets hardwired.
0:40:39 : Correct.
0:40:40 : Once you get hardwired- That means your
job as a leader who is regimening is
0:40:44 : to hardwire it to everybody's DNA.
0:40:45 : That is absolutely right.
0:40:47 : That is why I say a leadership role is
extremely important in any organisation.
0:40:51 : It could be a civil organisation.
0:40:53 : Now, when people say,
Our employees are not following this,
0:40:57 : they're not following it because
you didn't hardwire it into them.
0:41:00 : They need to create.
0:41:02 : Who creates environments?
0:41:03 : The leadership which creates environments.
0:41:05 : How do environments get created?
0:41:07 : It is what you reward and what you punish.
0:41:10 : If you reward a certain way of behaviour,
everybody follows that.
0:41:14 : That is how even the species develops.
0:41:17 : Whatever benefits you,
that gets bolstered.
0:41:21 : Whatever is not benefiting becomes
vestigial and ultimately is lost.
0:41:27 : Unless you do that and you keep carrying
out internal reviews as to what is it we
0:41:33 : are doing which is right and what is it we
are doing, those practises which are not
0:41:37 : that great, and you keep winnowing it
and weaning it away and getting
0:41:41 : the right one each time.
0:41:42 : It's a dynamic process.
0:41:43 : When people think it is just
one enclosure we put them in and they come
0:41:47 : out like that,
it doesn't happen like that.
0:41:49 : It is a very dynamic process.
0:41:52 : Now, there is a negative
connotation of régimentation.
0:41:55 : Is this so-called,
we are developing robots,
0:41:58 : they're making them automated They just
respond to this, which is nonsense.
0:42:03 : We are talking about
a discipline of habit.
0:42:07 : If
you would have a discipline of habit
0:42:10 : wherein you will be getting up
at a certain time,
0:42:12 : following a certain routine,
then contributing, I mean,
0:42:15 : devoting some time to maybe self-growth or
professional growth,
0:42:19 : and then working for a certain number
of hours, then coming back,
0:42:22 : devoting time to...
That's a discipline of routine.
0:42:24 : You don't deviate from it.
0:42:26 : It obviously has benefits.
0:42:28 : Now, I can give you a more A real example
from my world right now,
0:42:31 : just to give you a perspective.
0:42:33 : See, when we go into OT to operate,
we have a clear plan.
0:42:37 : You leave your shoe here,
beyond this line, no shoe.
0:42:39 : Then you go in, you have
to change to the scrubs.
0:42:42 : And beyond this line, no civil clothes.
0:42:44 : Beyond this line, only scrubs.
0:42:46 : Then when you go in, you have to put this
sterilisation stuff.
0:42:49 : If I'm going to scrub up for the case,
I need to remove everything.
0:42:52 : I need to roll up my sleeve.
0:42:54 : I need to scrub myself above my elbow.
0:42:56 : Then three times in a particular way,
they even tell us how to
0:43:00 : between the fingers and all of those
things to make sure
0:43:03 : there's no rubbish there.
0:43:04 : Then I go in, there's
a particular way I wipe it.
0:43:07 : I don't touch anything else after that.
0:43:10 : The sterility is
maintained at every point.
0:43:12 : You can't say, I don't want to go.
0:43:14 : You can't say all of that because
it is régimentation.
0:43:17 : Let's accept reality.
And worldwide, the same thing is done.
0:43:20 : It eliminates risks.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
0:43:22 : You can't say that this
is not régimentation.
0:43:25 : This is stupid.
0:43:26 : Some people, I think just not wanting
to do it, I think you use all this
0:43:31 : freedom and all of this to escape.
0:43:34 : It is not counterproductive to freedom.
It's not.
0:43:37 : It is not.
Exactly.
0:43:38 : It is not the time you spend in something.
0:43:40 : It is what you produce out of that time.
0:43:43 : In this, the same example you gave.
0:43:45 : Now, let's say a army patrol
is going, it gets ambushed.
0:43:49 : One of the things which régimentation does
in a tactical scenario is it builds
0:43:56 : reactive tactical drills.
0:43:59 : If When you come under fire, it is
that you have to charge into the ambush.
0:44:03 : Now, if you ask a person,
fire is coming from a certain point,
0:44:07 : will you charge into it?
He'll not want to.
0:44:09 : But that is the safest way
to get out of an ambush.
0:44:12 : Oh, really?
Yes.
0:44:12 : Interesting.
0:44:13 : Because if you're moving- You
actually go into the firing.
0:44:15 : Because you're reducing distance.
0:44:16 : Whereas if you're moving away from it,
the ambush party is not at risk.
0:44:22 : They have time to pick and choose and to-
So you are actually threatening him back.
0:44:26 : Exactly.
0:44:26 : Now he's panicking, probably not
responding as well as he would respond.
0:44:30 : You are rapidly closing distance.
0:44:33 : You are now coming on to it
and beating that ambush.
0:44:36 : That has to be regimened into you
because it's not a natural response.
0:44:40 : Of course.
Natural response is FFF.
0:44:42 : Fear, fight, flight.
0:44:43 : You pack up and go.
That's what it is.
0:44:45 : The same thing in rest, where otherwise,
if left to you, you gave the procedure in
0:44:49 : an OT, you would want to take a shortcut.
0:44:52 : But a shortcut leads to risks coming in.
0:44:55 : Why should you take a shortcut?
0:44:57 : You have to put through
that entire procedure.
0:44:58 : Actually, it's worse.
0:45:00 : It becomes a long cut because the moment
you shortcut something,
0:45:03 : the complications happen.
0:45:04 : Then what I would have done then middle
of the night, I'm called back,
0:45:07 : something else happened.
Two days later, I'm doing something else.
0:45:09 : It fails.
0:45:10 : It fails because you have
to do it the way it is.
0:45:13 : Absolutely.
0:45:13 : I always tell my patients and everybody
this is it takes the gynaecologist
0:45:18 : nine months to have a baby.
0:45:19 : It takes an orthopaedic surgeon three
months for the fracture to heal.
0:45:22 : You can't make it any faster.
0:45:24 : Because your body only
takes so much of time.
0:45:26 : If you get the baby out in under seven
months, you have to have a paid incubator.
0:45:31 : This is a free incubator
and the safest place to be.
0:45:34 : You can't be in a hurry.
0:45:36 : In an artificial incubator,
you can get a baby out faster?
0:45:40 : No, if your baby prematurely comes out,
then you have to keep an incubation
0:45:45 : because the baby is premature.
0:45:47 : That is caused and the risk is so high.
0:45:49 : You have to prevent this premature birth
from happening as much as possible.
0:45:53 : That's where they look at the minimum age
of the baby before they
0:45:55 : allow this and all of those.
0:45:56 : Those things going on.
0:45:59 : I I see the regimenation you made so clear
about the fact that you have
0:46:03 : to have that process going.
0:46:05 : I can see it very clearly
because we have to have it.
0:46:08 : Because if you don't do,
then people do their own stuff.
0:46:10 : If the people do their own stuff,
how does it go into work?
0:46:13 : It's not going to benefit anybody.
It's chaos.
0:46:16 : Second is,
most organisations
0:46:19 : which know what they are doing,
it is through a set of activities.
0:46:23 : People don't understand why you're
being put through those activities.
0:46:26 : Through a set of activities,
like in most military units, you're
0:46:29 : put through a It's a set of activities.
0:46:31 : Can we give an example or just give it so
that if people want to structure them,
0:46:34 : just as a place to think.
0:46:36 : For example, let's say your
morning starts with a routine.
0:46:40 : It could be 5: 30, 6: 00, whatever.
0:46:43 : It starts with a physical routine.
0:46:45 : Then straight away within a certain period
of time, you are supposed to change,
0:46:51 : take a bath, have your breakfast, come in,
and then you are now distributed clearly
0:46:56 : into different tasks which you
have to do for that particular day.
0:47:00 : There is no slip-ups in it because
slip-ups have consequences.
0:47:04 : As part of their activity itself,
they are seeing the functioning.
0:47:09 : Now, something has gone wrong,
you don't hide it.
0:47:11 : You own up that this has gone wrong,
we need to set it right.
0:47:14 : It builds in the openness.
0:47:16 : This also army builds that into, say,
to-Exactly, by the way of functioning.
0:47:21 : If an organisation says now-I think that's
the toughest part, general saab,
0:47:25 : because everybody gets worried, I'm
going to get this, I'm going to get that.
0:47:28 : They're trying to bury the whole thing.
0:47:30 : There are career consequences.
0:47:31 : If an organisation, let's say,
misses out on tax return,
0:47:34 : I'm just an example, and let's say
it says, No, we need to hide this.
0:47:37 : That becomes an ethical practise of this.
0:47:40 : It cannot be a one-off because now
people know you have done that.
0:47:44 : There will be other compromises
which are taking place in other places.
0:47:48 : To hide one, you do another one.
0:47:50 : That becomes your company ethos then.
0:47:53 : The ethos has to be built in even
with the smallest activity.
0:47:58 : There
has to be a symbolic disproportionate
0:48:03 : consequence for a wrong activity.
0:48:05 : Because how do you deter
the wrong activity?
0:48:08 : To deter that,
in strategic deterrence,
0:48:13 : there is a principle.
When two nations are near equals, how do
0:48:17 : you prevent the nation from going to war?
0:48:23 : Let's take a hypothetical case.
0:48:25 : There are a Nation A and a Nation B.
0:48:27 : A Nation A and Nation B are nearly equal.
0:48:30 : Now you want to...
0:48:31 : And Nation B provokes Nation A every time,
but you don't want it to escalate further.
0:48:37 : For escalation control,
it is called a deterrence strategy.
0:48:42 : The deterrence strategy is
when Nation B provokes in a small manner,
0:48:47 : a small action,
you respond disproportionately so
0:48:52 : that it deters the next higher action.
0:48:54 : I remember that that's what our defence
minister, Rajnath singh,
0:48:58 : had told very clearly in one
of the I think, yes, I remember that.
0:49:01 : That's when I learned how do
you do the strategy deters.
0:49:04 : Ideally, this should work.
0:49:05 : I mean, of course,
there are certain irrational actors where
0:49:08 : sometimes it doesn't work,
but rationally, this should work.
0:49:11 : Similarly, in organisations, even if the
0:49:17 : default or the action is not very major,
0:49:21 : you need to respond,
at least symbolically,
0:49:24 : in a manner which shows that it is a major
one because that will deter
0:49:28 : a higher Higher indiscipline.
Issue.
0:49:32 : Let me see if I understood you right.
0:49:33 : What you are trying to tell our viewers
and me is that if somebody makes some
0:49:38 : mistake or some slip- Which is not
in tune with your company ethos.
0:49:41 : Ethos.
Technically, it's not a very big thing.
0:49:45 : But if you don't give cognizance to,.
0:49:49 : That will increase them to continue
to slip up and do bigger slip-ups.
0:49:54 : But if you overreact to make sure you fix
that place, then they will realise,
0:49:58 : even if a small I got such a big
penalty or whatever this one.
0:50:03 : Which is viewed seriously.
0:50:04 : So that the next level
can be more impacting.
0:50:06 : Absolutely.
Got it.
0:50:07 : I think that's a- The reason in that,
as you said, is that even if I overlook
0:50:12 : a small thing, you think that,
Okay, this is how we are.
0:50:15 : It is like standards.
0:50:16 : Exactly what you said, mediocrity.
0:50:18 : If I accept, let's say you have house
help, and I'm giving an example,
0:50:25 : and the house help says that does a job
in a very slipshored manner Because they
0:50:30 : think you are never,
ever going to point it out.
0:50:32 : Then it only escalates and it
spirals further downwards.
0:50:36 : Now, let's say you point it out and you
say, This is not acceptable to me.
0:50:40 : Then they know that, No, it is not.
0:50:41 : This work will not pass must.
0:50:44 : I need to perform to that level.
0:50:46 : Whether it be an individual,
it's being observed and it is being
0:50:49 : observed, and it is being noted,
and it is being told to me.
0:50:51 : There is no shyness on my part.
0:50:54 : See, the problem in most leaders is,
one, is they are shy
0:51:00 : in ticking off people.
Correct.
0:51:03 : Looking good or not looking bad.
Yes.
0:51:07 : So popularity is not a thing.
0:51:09 : But of course, the other side is also bad,
wherein you become so toxic that you
0:51:13 : are ticking off for the sake of.
0:51:15 : So balance is necessary in everything.
0:51:17 : So balance is necessary.
0:51:19 : I want to say two things
here to add to what you said.
0:51:23 : I'll do the second part
for just what you said.
0:51:25 : See, I learned this from my sister.
0:51:28 : She's an elder sister to me.
0:51:31 : She lives in the US.
0:51:32 : She's an American citizen.
0:51:34 : When she came for one of her visits
to India with her daughter for the first
0:51:38 : time after the daughter was born,
she was probably three years old
0:51:41 : or two years old, the daughter.
0:51:43 : She threw one of her tantrums,
the usual stuff.
0:51:46 : I heard her sitting her down and telling
her, Sanjana, I like you,
0:51:50 : but not this behaviour.
0:51:52 : She clearly separated the two.
0:51:55 : I'm telling you, that was one
of the biggest lessons I learned.
0:52:00 : Because if you see the baggage we carry,
my father doesn't like me,
0:52:03 : my mother doesn't like me,
because every time you said,
0:52:05 : You're like this, you're like this,
they think they don't like you.
0:52:08 : But she clearly distinguishes the person
with the habit, with the action.
0:52:13 : Then she understood, Oh,
mama likes this, but doesn't like this.
0:52:16 : Correct.
It modulates the behaviour.
0:52:18 : Yes, it modulates the behaviour and make
them clear that this is
0:52:22 : not a big deal to change.
Absolutely.
0:52:24 : I think that's a fantastic
way of looking at how it goes.
0:52:28 : The problem, I
I see this because I go for some to take
0:52:33 : certain classes, and I'm speaking...
0:52:35 : I mean, in the past few months,
I've been speaking to certain
0:52:39 : organisations also when they want
me to speak to their employees.
0:52:43 : The thing in this
thing is that making these changes
0:52:48 : in habits organizationally is a science.
0:52:51 : How to mould group behaviour is a science.
0:52:54 : We need to train people for that.
0:52:56 : Our leaders need to be trained for that.
0:52:58 : Not everything can be
anecdotal or by observation.
0:53:01 : They have to be trained in doing this.
0:53:03 : The problem is, I agree with you because I
also run big organisation and we
0:53:07 : actually got really challenged.
0:53:10 : We bloodied our nose,
we had mud on our face.
0:53:14 : Then The hard way, as you understand,
because we were just crawling through this
0:53:18 : whole thing before we realised that we had
to get the method in this whole madness.
0:53:22 : That's when we also took our own classes
and our own guidance from experts
0:53:26 : and things like this.
0:53:26 : Because see, what you said is this
leadership is not taught
0:53:29 : in in an organised way.
0:53:30 : The people who teach may not
even have done it on the ground.
0:53:34 : They just get some theory
knowledge and things like this.
0:53:36 : But before we go down this
path- I have a single daughter.
0:53:40 : I had my daughter late in the sense that
I was, what, 43 Or maybe '44 or maybe
0:53:46 : 44 or 45 when my daughter was born.
0:53:47 : At that time, I already finished command
of a unit, and I was in a sensitive
0:53:51 : staff appointment.
0:53:52 : In a division, I was the Colonel General
staff that is in charge
0:53:56 : of operational planning.
0:53:57 : As everybody knows in the military,
when you are the Colonel General Staff
0:54:02 : in a division, it is one of the busiest
appointments you can
0:54:05 : find in the Indian army.
0:54:06 : You have to stay late nights,
you go early mornings.
0:54:09 : There are plannings going on,
operational plannings going on.
0:54:13 : At that time, my daughter was eight months
old or probably nine months old,
0:54:16 : and my wife was alone at house.
0:54:18 : You can understand the pressures
which happen on your wife
0:54:23 : to get out of the .
The emotional.
0:54:25 : In that entire tenure of two years,
I was back home.
0:54:30 : I would be in office at 8: 00.
0:54:31 : I was back home by 2: 30 AM.
0:54:34 : No, 8: 00 in the morning,
I would go to AM, and I would
0:54:37 : back by 2: 30 PM in the afternoon.
0:54:40 : But invariably, the routine was that you
would stay on till about 7:
0:54:45 : 00 at night, 8: 00 at night.
0:54:47 : But the reason I did that was
that I would take my work home.
0:54:52 : I want to just shift a little bit of gear
about you used to love sports, you say.
0:54:57 : Yeah, that's right.
0:55:00 : One of the few guys from India
who's not crazy about cricket.
0:55:04 : That I thought was very interesting.
0:55:06 : My apologies.
0:55:09 : But I just don't like cricket.
0:55:10 : You're going to beat you up for this.
0:55:13 : I may be wrong because I just
don't find it athletic enough.
0:55:17 : It's not challenging enough.
0:55:18 : A lot of people say, especially
test match is a lazy guy's game.
0:55:21 : People just hanging
around doing this stuff.
0:55:24 : But I agree with you.
But anyway, I am a cricket buff.
0:55:27 : But my apologies.
No, you don't have to be apologetic.
0:55:29 : For the Grinder, larger audience.
0:55:31 : Which are the games and all the sports
people that inspired you and why?
0:55:37 : That's a good question, again, and that
puts me in a spot for the simple reason.
0:55:42 : I love individual sports Because
to my mind,
0:55:48 : individual sports is the acme or
a representation of pure excellence
0:55:54 : in its basic fundamental form.
Why do you say that?
0:55:57 : I say that because let's say you
When you see the Olympics,
0:56:00 : let's say track and field,
and you have a 5,000-metre runner
0:56:04 : or let's say a 400-metre runner.
0:56:07 : It is pure will,
preparation, training, and motivation.
0:56:14 : There is no external add-on in this.
0:56:17 : There is no equipment better,
there is no opportunity better.
0:56:19 : It is pure one human being versus
the other in their most basic element.
0:56:26 : And anybody who performs well in that,
it's obviously It shows in every one
0:56:31 : of these parameters, they're scoring high.
0:56:34 : I love watching these.
0:56:37 : I've been watching Olympics
from a child onwards.
0:56:39 : I love watching these,
especially track and field.
0:56:43 : I am an admirer of athletic
performance which you cannot relate to.
0:56:49 : The reason now why I find I don't find is
when I see cricket,
0:56:55 : I feel that I can do that.
0:56:58 : I may be right or wrong,
but I feel I can do that.
0:57:02 : It's not that difficult.
0:57:04 : But when I see, let's say, one
0:57:10 : of the Olympic athletes running,
0:57:12 : let's say, the 5,000 metres,
I know I can't do that.
0:57:15 : It is way beyond.
0:57:16 : There is no question I can do that.
0:57:18 : When I see Tour de France,
I don't know whether you have seen these
0:57:20 : Netflix series of Tour
de France Unchained.
0:57:23 : There are three seasons
which they- No, I've not seen.
0:57:25 : But I've seen Tour de France somehow,
but the original thing-
0:57:27 : You should see the- I see.
Especially season one.
0:57:29 : I I think it is that whole series,
Netflix series is a lesson of life.
0:57:35 : Really?
It's called Tour de France.
0:57:37 : Tour de France.
It's a proper.
0:57:38 : What they have done is Tour
de France happens every year.
0:57:40 : I know that.
0:57:41 : This one, they have tracked the major
teams and the major athletes throughout
0:57:46 : the 2021, 2022, 2023 Tour
de France entire race.
0:57:51 : They have made a series out of it.
0:57:53 : It puts the athlete under a microscope.
0:57:55 : Their performance under...
0:57:57 : Some of the facts which were...
0:58:00 : Now, they cycle at average
speeds of 60 miles per hour.
0:58:03 : That means you go off the road, you die.
0:58:07 : The Tour de France, a team has, I think,
seven riders,
0:58:12 : but there is only one alpha male in that.
0:58:14 : That means the whole team is working
to put one guy in the winner's
0:58:19 : position when the race ends.
I didn't know this.
0:58:21 : The whole team is working towards that.
Why?
0:58:24 : When you're cycling, I didn't...
Again, these things I didn't know.
0:58:26 : When you're cycling, 70% of your energy
is spent overcoming wind resistance.
0:58:32 : 70%.
0:58:33 : If you're the front of the race,
you are going to be exhausted
0:58:37 : before you're gone halfway.
0:58:39 : The team protects their main rider who's
always riding three or four places behind.
0:58:44 : They sacrifice themselves one by one
and put this guy in a position that he
0:58:50 : can mount in assault at the end.
Interesting.
0:58:52 : The team is sacrificing itself
for one individual's glory.
0:58:56 : But it is a team's effort.
0:58:59 : It teaches It teaches to subsume.
0:59:02 : Each of these riders are superstars
in their own right,
0:59:05 : but they are willing to forego their
chances because they find that that guy
0:59:09 : is best suited to do this.
0:59:11 : In fact, the effort
required is huge in this.
0:59:15 : I admire those games wherein the spirit
comes through of effort
0:59:20 : and athletic ability.
0:59:23 : The games which I don't like too much is
where I feel the ability is not that much.
0:59:29 : I may be wrong, fully wrong in that,
but that is the perception I have.
0:59:32 : You are particularly mentioned Carl Lewis
and Michael Johnson as two guys who are
0:59:39 : really-I mean, even now,
I like this female hurdler, Femke Bull.
0:59:43 : I find her and the American equal,
Sydney McLaurin, I think her
0:59:49 : name is, to watch them run.
0:59:51 : They run for the pure passion of running.
0:59:54 : In fact, the Olympics,
there was a mixed relay.
0:59:57 : Olympics nowadays has
a 4 into 400 mixed relay.
1:00:00 : I didn't know.
I don't know if you're aware of that.
1:00:02 : That means two male runners
and two female runners.
1:00:06 : This Femke bol is the last runner,
and she was trailing by, I think,
1:00:10 : seventh position or something.
Seventh?
1:00:11 : Yeah, sixth or something.
1:00:13 : She was trailing by about 60
metres or so, and she comes first.
1:00:17 : I mean, it's a race
for the ages to see that.
1:00:22 : I should go back and see.
I should see that.
1:00:24 : It's here in YouTube, you will see it.
1:00:27 : It's a triumph of human will.
1:00:29 : When When you see that happening in front
of you, you can't help but admire.
1:00:34 : Those are things I like doing.
1:00:36 : They are extreme motivations that you
can do it if you put your mind to it.
1:00:41 : Is this your thing for athletics coming
from that anecdote you said,
1:00:46 : you were running without good spikes
and you did a good 400-metre chase?
1:00:51 : Yeah, that is not my case itself.
1:00:54 : I'm talking about 1983,
I joined the National Defence Academy.
1:00:59 : 1986, '87, I passed out
of the Indian minute.
1:01:01 : Those days, nothing was there.
1:01:04 : You were running on dirt tracks.
1:01:06 : So I used to run track.
1:01:08 : I used to run before 8
and 1,500 metres at that time.
1:01:12 : And 400, I used to win each time.
1:01:15 : I still remember my last timing,
that was in '86, I did that.
1:01:19 : How much do you practise?
1:01:20 : You are in a training academy.
1:01:21 : It's a military training academy.
1:01:23 : Athletics is not the- It's not the same.
It's a competition.
1:01:26 : It's a competition.
You train for what?
1:01:28 : Two weeks, three weeks maximum?
1:01:30 : You run on dirt track, you run on spikes,
which dig both ways
1:01:34 : into your sole, into this.
1:01:37 : They're as bad.
1:01:38 : I did 50 seconds.
1:01:40 : I remember in both the semifinals and
the finals, I ran in 50 seconds in those.
1:01:45 : Sometimes I feel that, yes,
if I had prepared for maybe it would have
1:01:50 : dropped the timing so much by in 50
seconds was a good timing even then.
1:01:55 : It's something which I think it is
The spirit of competition
1:02:01 : comes out best in these events.
1:02:03 : The extension that you said was about
international sports journalism.
1:02:07 : Yeah, absolutely.
1:02:08 : I also heard that thing in your voice
and your glint in your
1:02:12 : eyes when you said that.
1:02:13 : What about This is international
journalists that you like so much.
1:02:17 : I mean, I must say this.
1:02:19 : I read ESPN inside out.
1:02:21 : I go online every day.
I read it, si.
1:02:24 : Com.
I read all the articles.
1:02:25 : Really?
Which one?
1:02:26 : Which is that one?
Sportsillustrator.
1:02:28 : Com.
I read everything, espn.
1:02:30 : Com.
1:02:30 : I
find sports journalists capture human
1:02:35 : emotion better than anybody else because
they are seeing it
1:02:39 : unfold in front of them.
1:02:40 : They are seeing somebody being
defeated, somebody winning.
1:02:43 : They are seeing somebody putting an effort
in vain and somebody may not be putting
1:02:47 : that much of effort, but still coming out.
1:02:49 : They can capture emotions,
whether it be a football match.
1:02:52 : By the way, I read even the Premier League
write-ups, the British writers who write
1:02:56 : on the Premier League football
league, which happens every year.
1:03:03 : They write beautifully and they capture
the essence of emotion so well
1:03:08 : it can serve as a motivation for you.
1:03:10 : I still remember one of the articles.
1:03:12 : You're saying that as you read it,
you can actually pictureize it.
1:03:14 : You can even get the emotions.
1:03:17 : Yeah, I got it.
1:03:18 : You get involved in it.
I get that.
1:03:20 : I can see that.
1:03:21 : Especially when they highlight
the adversities an athlete has gone
1:03:25 : through and now he's delivering.
1:03:27 : Maybe a surgery or something like that.
1:03:30 : I still remember when I read an article,
and that is the time I run every day, that
1:03:35 : as you age, the various
aches and pains come up.
1:03:39 : Sometimes, a lot of times, the thought
comes to your mind, is it worth it?
1:03:44 : Is it worth it?
1:03:46 : Because everybody tells you, as you age,
you need to slow down,
1:03:49 : you shouldn't run as much,
and write from your own family
1:03:52 : to everybody around,
this is just a recipe for disaster.
1:03:56 : Every time when I would get up,
and I go get up pretty and then go,
1:04:00 : so every time I have to roll out
of bed, I think, is it worth it?
1:04:04 : Everybody says it's just not worth it.
1:04:07 : Then, as luck would have it,
that day I read in the ESP, again,
1:04:10 : a sports journalist written,
and he says, aches and pain.
1:04:13 : He's talking about himself He says ache.
1:04:16 : He's hardly, I think when he wrote,
he was some 40 or something,
1:04:19 : and I'm much beyond that.
1:04:21 : He's written, he says,
Aks and pains are a part of life.
1:04:25 : He's written, he says,
The day you succumb to that pain,
1:04:28 : you never start He says,
You just have to go on.
1:04:33 : It just doesn't matter
until you overcome it.
1:04:36 : You keep doing it.
1:04:37 : Whatever be the pain, whatever be the
effort which is involved,
1:04:40 : it is all worth it.
1:04:41 : Because the day you succumb to that,
you are never going to restart.
1:04:46 : When I was supposed to in the US, that is
one thing I really admired about that.
1:04:51 : I would see from my house a man,
he would be easily 75 or over 75.
1:04:55 : In the US?
In the US.
1:04:57 : He was struggling to run,
but he would never walk.
1:05:00 : He would limp and whatever,
but he would run.
1:05:04 : You had to admire that effort.
1:05:07 : You could make out that it is a struggle
for him, but it just didn't stop him.
1:05:12 : I mean, anybody would be easy
to walk it, but he wouldn't walk.
1:05:15 : I'm relating two immediate
stories from my own stuff.
1:05:19 : One was obviously Rishab Pant.
1:05:20 : I don't know whether you heard about it.
Yeah, it was an accident.
1:05:22 : I mean, if you see that car crash,
it was like my-Escaped with his life.
1:05:26 : I mean, like you said,
something divine or some special energy
1:05:31 : To survive is big enough.
1:05:33 : To go through whatever he went through was
and get out of that is to come
1:05:37 : back and do all that thing.
1:05:39 : It's amazing what great determination
and everything else and whatever
1:05:44 : the energy The other person I
saw was a guy called John Dent.
1:05:48 : He's a tennis player.
1:05:50 : During the Amritra Raj Prado's time?
1:05:52 : No, he's much earlier.
1:05:54 : Maybe five, six years ago.
Oh, John Dent.
1:05:57 : Yeah.
1:05:57 : I saw him I had not heard much about him,
and I was just watching the
1:06:02 : US Open quarterfinals.
1:06:04 : He was playing, I don't know who he was
playing, but he was playing
1:06:07 : on the quarterfinals.
1:06:08 : As the commentator was talking about it,
he said, This guy has undergone
1:06:12 : three knee fusion surgeries.
1:06:16 : Three fusion surgeries.
1:06:17 : He's playing on that damn turf court
in US Open quarter files.
1:06:23 : They always said that surface
is the worst for the knee.
1:06:27 : That's right.
1:06:27 : How much he must have practised to be able
Good to play the game
1:06:30 : at that level to come to a…
1:06:32 : I mean, can you imagine what grit
and determination that guy had,
1:06:35 : the way you saw him moving,
you can't even imagine that he
1:06:38 : had anything to do with his knee.
1:06:40 : Same with Tiger Woods.
1:06:41 : I heard he had spine fusion surgery.
I think multiple.
1:06:43 : Yes.
1:06:44 : He still plays.
1:06:46 : I think one of the times,
he won his last Masters with his
1:06:51 : knee or one of the US opens with his
leg completely immobile.
1:06:56 : Correct.
1:06:57 : I think that's when the personal courage
comes in very, very, very importantly.
1:07:03 : Going back to your regimenation
and the organisation ethos or
1:07:08 : the organisation, whatever you said,
the code that you were talking about,
1:07:12 : you mentioned a very key phrase that is
very important for us to define
1:07:17 : called the Keystone Habit.
1:07:20 : Can you elaborate and help us understand
what is this Keystone Habit and how does
1:07:26 : this Keystone Habit fit
in the larger scheme of things?
1:07:29 : What should people like us wanting
to build successful,
1:07:34 : very nice, where the environment
to work is joyful rather than stressful?
1:07:40 : Can you guide us and give
us some wisdom on that?
1:07:44 : Sure.
See, individuals have habits.
1:07:48 : Organisations have routines.
1:07:51 : Routines in organisations
are habits of individuals.
1:07:56 : When you connect these routines,
the single critical routine,
1:08:01 : a subcomponent of a routine or an action
which an organisation does,
1:08:06 : which has the potential to impact its
total functioning is a Keystone habit.
1:08:13 : Can you give an example?
1:08:17 : Let's say the army.
1:08:18 : I will give you an example
of the military.
1:08:22 : We are all aware that especially the
combat infantry,
1:08:26 : the critical requirement for a combat
for combat infantry is to be able
1:08:32 : to physically carry out an action.
1:08:34 : To physically carry out an action,
you have to be fit.
1:08:39 : If you have to be fit,
you have to be fit on a daily basis.
1:08:43 : There is a routine which you have to do
on a daily basis, which keeps
1:08:47 : your fitness to its apex level.
1:08:50 : The activity which you do
becomes a keystone habit.
1:08:53 : Got it.
1:08:55 : Actually, I was struggling when
you told me this, How do you find?
1:08:59 : And you gave an amazing answer.
1:09:01 : Now, let me relate it to how do
you change an organisational habit.
1:09:05 : Perfect.
1:09:06 : Now, if a physical activity,
and let's take a hypothetical case wherein
1:09:11 : this military units, physical activity is
in the morning, it does its physical
1:09:18 : PT, physical training.
1:09:19 : Maybe in the evening,
it develops camaraderie
1:09:22 : and cohesion through team sports.
1:09:25 : Let's take the first habit.
1:09:26 : Let's say PT is the first activity which
it's doing, which is a keystone habit.
1:09:32 : If you now impact this particular habit,
you will be able to impact
1:09:38 : the functioning of the unit.
How?
1:09:42 : Getting up in the morning,
carrying out an activity will entail
1:09:46 : that he has to be earlier to bed.
1:09:50 : Obviously, that means his habit
gets- So that he gets rested.
1:09:53 : Rest in that.
1:09:54 : His diet has to be good enough
that it is not affecting his body.
1:09:57 : His sleep has to be okay.
1:09:59 : His Discipline has to be okay because he
has to adhere to that activity
1:10:03 : on a consistent basis.
1:10:05 : There are multiple intangibles
which are getting associated with this.
1:10:09 : Intangibles.
That's a key, very important word.
1:10:12 : It's not a tangible.
I can see that.
1:10:13 : It's not a first-order impact.
I agree.
1:10:15 : I understand.
1:10:16 : It's a second-order
effect which is happening.
1:10:19 : If you want to improve, let's say,
discipline of a unit,
1:10:23 : you concentrate on its physical activity.
1:10:26 : I'm giving you as physical activity
being a keystone happening.
1:10:29 : Yes.
1:10:30 : Now, I say that my standard for this unit
1:10:34 : is going to be 100% of you will pass
1:10:38 : these tests at this level.
1:10:41 : That will mean that they have to now put
in that much effort,
1:10:45 : which could mean regulating the sleep,
means practising more,
1:10:48 : means improving their diet.
1:10:49 : Whatever it means to,
whatever it takes to be there.
1:10:52 : There.
1:10:53 : Now it has a lot of effect on their
kanega, on their activities which are
1:10:58 : connected to this, but you're
not actually You're targeting it.
1:11:00 : You're targeting this particular one.
1:11:02 : But the benefits are going
to be seen in multiple ways.
1:11:05 : And you're benchmarking it because you
have got that endpoint
1:11:07 : that you are looking at.
1:11:08 : But the benefits, as you said,
as I said, is going to be on multiple.
1:11:12 : You'll find that discipline will be better
because it's getting into their routine.
1:11:17 : And it will spill over in another place.
1:11:18 : The pride will be more.
1:11:20 : That same passion and the same standards
with their showing here,
1:11:23 : they will show it in some other
task which they've been given to.
1:11:26 : It is not to say that all
these are a given.
1:11:32 : Some things will work,
some things will not work.
1:11:35 : That is how life is, it's trial and error.
1:11:38 : What doesn't work, let it go.
1:11:40 : What works, increase its penetration,
increase its span.
1:11:46 : But you should be able to understand
what is working, what is not working.
1:11:51 : A lot of times, leaders are blind to it.
1:11:53 : They don't understand what is working,
they don't understand what is not working.
1:11:57 : Why?
1:11:58 : Because they don't take feedback.
1:12:00 : They are not on the ground,
which you said earlier.
1:12:02 : They are not seeing with their own eyes.
1:12:04 : They are hearing through
a second person's voice.
1:12:07 : A lot of leaders- That's
the most dangerous thing.
1:12:10 : See,
when I get a call at 2: 00 in the morning
1:12:13 : and I hear somebody giving
me a data of a patient.
1:12:16 : I am sleeping.
1:12:17 : I have woken up, you understand?
1:12:19 : It's not that I have woken up fresh.
1:12:21 : I'm just open my eyes
and the phone is in my ear.
1:12:24 : At that level of whatever it is,
I should know whether
1:12:27 : the data coming in is correct.
1:12:29 : It's Absolutely.
1:12:30 : If I hear a new voice,
I'm asking, Who are you?
1:12:34 : Because I need to know who is
this person giving me the data?
1:12:38 : If it's a person who doesn't understand,
he's garbage in, garbage
1:12:41 : out at the end of the day.
1:12:42 : Others, I say, Who else is on call?
1:12:45 : Give it to that person.
1:12:46 : Have you seen the patient?
1:12:47 : I have to cross-question.
1:12:48 : Show me this, show me this, do me this.
1:12:50 : I have to do all of that.
1:12:52 : That means I have to be more awake than I
would have been when I was awake
1:12:55 : to make sure I get the right data in.
1:12:57 : Unless I train myself to do this,
I'm I'm waking up in my sleep like this,
1:13:01 : I cannot be functional as a neurosurgeon.
1:13:03 : I'll become a daytime neurosurgeon.
1:13:05 : I won't become a 24 by 7 neurosurgeon.
1:13:07 : I can see very clearly where you're
getting it, and that's
1:13:10 : the habit that you do.
1:13:12 : That's the thing.
1:13:15 : All those other activities, now the ACME,
1:13:19 : the measure of skill is first
1:13:23 : in an organisation routine,
you have to identify that Keystone habit.
1:13:26 : It's not the same.
That's the biggest part.
1:13:28 : It's not the same for every Can you give
me another example in a civilian
1:13:32 : place or in any company?
1:13:33 : Just for the thing of- It is not
my original example, but it is a place
1:13:37 : which I read it, which is a proven one.
1:13:40 : I only hope I have time to say
that because it's a little longer.
1:13:44 : No, it's a time.
1:13:45 : There used to be, where I
picked this up is from a book.
1:13:48 : There used to be a company,
I don't know where they're still there,
1:13:52 : Aluminium Company of America,
which at why it's Zenith.
1:13:56 : In the late '80s, early '90s, it had
over 200,000, 300,000 employees globally.
1:14:02 : I still remember they got
1:14:07 : a CEO who was not from the aluminium
1:14:10 : industry and he was a bureaucrat,
but a bureaucrat with a track record
1:14:15 : of innovation, organisational
change, a thinking CEO.
1:14:18 : They got him in.
1:14:19 : In his first shareholder address,
he says, My priority is,
1:14:26 : and the shareholders were all listening,
We will grow profits by this,
1:14:30 : shareholder benefits, dividends.
1:14:31 : This is employee safety.
1:14:36 : Our accidents are one per week.
1:14:38 : I'm going to reduce it to zero.
1:14:40 : One per week leads to so many man-hours
lost or man-months loss,
1:14:45 : and we need to cut that down,
and I want to bring it down to zero.
1:14:48 : A lot of people withdrew their money
from it saying, The CEO has no clue.
1:14:52 : They put a lot of pressure,
but they didn't change that.
1:14:55 : Science and the beauty of this was,
when he addressed employee
1:15:00 : safety, it required...
1:15:02 : This was a keystone habit
which he had identified.
1:15:06 : It meant that the employees
have to get more involved.
1:15:09 : Their practises on the shop
floor had to be safe enough.
1:15:13 : When you want to make it safe
enough, it becomes efficient.
1:15:16 : It gets regular.
1:15:17 : Everything comes under scrutiny.
1:15:19 : He also passed an instruction that
if an accident occurs on the floor,
1:15:25 : I require to know about it along with your
suggestions how this will It can never be
1:15:30 : repeated or it can never
recur again within 2 hours.
1:15:33 : 2 hours?
In 2 hours.
1:15:36 : Now, the reason why this what this does
is, now, straight away,
1:15:40 : the manager of that facility or
the factory is in communication
1:15:44 : with the shop floor individual.
1:15:46 : It really breaks open communication
and flattens that network.
1:15:50 : Otherwise, it goes hierarchy.
1:15:51 : This government office.
1:15:54 : Send me for a triplicate and then do this
through proper channel
1:15:57 : and all that nonsense.
1:15:59 : Now, for It's for them to know that he
requires to take the views
1:16:02 : of the people who are affected.
Correct.
1:16:03 : He has to ask for suggestions.
1:16:05 : He has to ask for feedback.
1:16:06 : He has to put it through the filter
of whether this works and doesn't work.
1:16:10 : He has to get far more involved.
1:16:12 : That now improves company functioning.
It improves efficiency.
1:16:15 : It reduces casualties,
it empowers workers to give suggestions.
1:16:21 : Excited at the same time,
you couldn't reject that or react to it.
1:16:26 : Absolutely.
1:16:26 : No, but more importantly was, as I said,
because he had put in place the system,
1:16:30 : the system forced one, as I said,
the manager to be in touch with the person
1:16:34 : to seek their views of the workflow
employees as to what can be done about it.
1:16:40 : It generated an enthusiasm of sharing
feedbacks which are not
1:16:44 : related to an accident.
1:16:46 : They got unconnected feedback also.
Feedback also.
1:16:50 : Like, as I said, if somebody-It's like a
big bazaar plan, buy one, take two, free.
1:16:54 : No, and they said that.
1:16:55 : They said, Why should the manager
get the reserved parking?
1:16:59 : I'm Coming to work at seven o'clock,
whoever is coming first
1:17:02 : should get the parking.
1:17:04 : They did away with the reserved
parking based on employee feedback.
1:17:07 : I believe in Japan,
this is much later that I read, in Japan,
1:17:12 : the parkings which are closest to the work
facility are reserved for people
1:17:17 : who come the earliest.
1:17:19 : No, who come late.
1:17:20 : Sorry, come late.
1:17:21 : The guy who come in early for parking
because the guy has to get in fast.
1:17:26 : But in this case, they said that if I'm
coming in early, I I should be
1:17:31 : getting the advantage of it.
1:17:32 : So they actually implemented it.
1:17:33 : So that is again a keystone
habit which he changed.
1:17:36 : That is safety became a keystone habit,
and they reduced actually
1:17:40 : accidents to zero.
1:17:42 : But it had an attendant impact on profits.
1:17:44 : Profit skyrocketed because your
efficiencies became so much more.
1:17:47 : The guys who exited must have
hung themselves probably.
1:17:52 : The person who wrote this says that I was
kicking myself after that,
1:17:54 : why did I leave?
1:17:56 : See, it's just amazing.
1:17:58 : It's just amazing how the
collateral benefits are significant.
1:18:02 : It has to be thought through.
1:18:04 : Yeah, it has to be thought through.
1:18:05 : The entire thing, there is
something called, what is it?
1:18:10 : Foundational cause.
1:18:11 : Every problem, the same guy who was
the CEO of Alcoa, the aluminium Company
1:18:17 : of America, at some point,
I believe he was the education,
1:18:19 : like our bureaucracy, he was in the
bureaucracy and the education department.
1:18:24 : I'm not too sure this was 1970s or so.
1:18:27 : They found premature births
US premature deaths.
1:18:34 : In fact, the infant mortality in 1970s
America, as per what I had read
1:18:39 : in that book, was higher than
African sub-Saharan Africa.
1:18:43 : It was that high.
1:18:45 : They were extremely concerned by this.
1:18:48 : When they carried out a check as to what
is the reason, they found it was because
1:18:51 : the number of premature births were high.
1:18:53 : Why were the premature births high?
1:18:55 : They found teenage pregnancies were high.
1:18:57 : When teenage pregnancies were high,
they again went into the cause.
1:19:01 : Sorry, this whole issue is
called root cause theory.
1:19:03 : You have to identify the root cause.
1:19:06 : Root cause analysis.
1:19:07 : Then when they found out if,
what is that, teen pregnancies are high,
1:19:12 : how do we prevent this premature birth?
1:19:14 : They said, You have to improve nutrition.
1:19:17 : If you have to improve
nutrition, what do we do?
1:19:19 : Ask them to include nutrition
in the classes they conduct
1:19:23 : for these teens, girls and students.
1:19:27 : When they tried to execute that,
they found that the teacher said,
1:19:31 : We have no clue about nutrition.
1:19:32 : How can we teach them?
1:19:34 : Where they put the money to reduce
premature infant mortality deaths,
1:19:39 : they put the money in training
teachers about nutrition.
1:19:44 : Crazy.
1:19:45 : When they put the money to train
teachers-Seems so unconnected,
1:19:47 : far away from the-Exactly.
1:19:49 : The results bore fruit.
1:19:51 : They reduced infant mortality by 70%
within the next two or three years.
1:19:55 : Good grief.
There was a direct causal factor for this.
1:19:59 : But for you to reach that causal factor,
you have to apply your mind.
1:20:02 : There has to be a logical thought process,
a problem-solving approach which has
1:20:08 : to come in, wherein you go.
1:20:09 : Critical thinking abilities have to come
in, wherein it leads
1:20:13 : you to the root cause.
1:20:15 : Root cause, fantastic.
1:20:16 : This whole strategy, sorry,
the word which is identification strategy.
1:20:20 : You have to identify what is the cause.
1:20:24 : And really the cause.
1:20:25 : And you might think that you found
the cause, that that may not be
1:20:27 : the actual cause, and you go over.
1:20:29 : Now, the theory in this is that once-How
do you know you have hit the bottom?
1:20:32 : To hit the...
1:20:33 : If you're not hit the right cause,
you have to look at this.
1:20:35 : Now, let's say you put money in training
teachers and it doesn't
1:20:38 : impact the mortality rate.
1:20:40 : That means you haven't hit the root cause.
1:20:42 : You have to then prospectively
look at what's going on and saying.
1:20:46 : That is why trial
and error is so critical.
1:20:49 : In organisational change, you have to try.
1:20:52 : The more you try, the chances are you are
going to reach the actual cause or
1:20:57 : the actual activity or the It's an actual
policy which is going to impact the-
1:21:01 : once you get it, then you hardware it.
1:21:04 : You hardware it and scale it up across
all facilities, across everywhere.
1:21:09 : As I said, it's an entire
thing is a scientific process.
1:21:13 : People have to be trained in it.
1:21:15 : Now I have a follow-up question to this.
1:21:17 : So far, so good.
1:21:19 : You taught us this.
1:21:21 : We are going to put it in place.
1:21:22 : We do the trial and error, we get our
results, and then we put in place.
1:21:26 : One of the common things I have seen is
now I empower a second leader,
1:21:30 : hand over to him and say, Okay,
now we have got all these
1:21:33 : things, now you implement.
And suddenly things go away.
1:21:36 : Somehow something is not working properly.
1:21:40 : Where is that coming from now?
1:21:41 : Why is that happening in organisations?
1:21:44 : In the military, there is-
Did I get my- Absolutely.
1:21:49 : See, you have trained,
you have empowered a subordinate.
1:21:52 : There are two things.
One is it's a one-off occurrence.
1:21:55 : Then the leader has
to have tolerance for that.
1:21:57 : You have to allow room for growth Not everybody
is going to get it right
1:22:02 : the very first time.
There has to be room for errors.
1:22:04 : You grow on the job.
1:22:06 : Now, if it's happening repeatedly,
then there is a problem.
1:22:09 : Then obviously, either
the human resource which you have
1:22:13 : identified for this task and whom you have
empowered and you have trained is
1:22:19 : not meeting the standards required.
1:22:20 : I mean, wrong choice.
1:22:21 : Wrong choice, possibly.
1:22:23 : What we say, horses for courses.
1:22:25 : Yeah, horses for courses, absolutely.
You require to have…
1:22:27 : You have to give adequate opportunities.
1:22:30 : You have to be extremely
objective in your assessment.
1:22:32 : Once you are clear that this is not
working out, and it happens multiple
1:22:36 : times, you have to change project leaders,
you have to change team leaders.
1:22:40 : Even in the military,
you change unit commanders,
1:22:43 : you change appointments because they are
unable to meet up to the expectations
1:22:50 : which the organisation has from them.
1:22:52 : There is nothing unusual about it.
1:22:55 : But in the initial stages,
that is the thing.
1:22:57 : The dictum is you Trust, but verify.
1:23:01 : That means you have to handhold
not overtly, but subtly.
1:23:07 : Trust but?
Verify.
1:23:08 : Verify.
1:23:09 : I can trust you to do something,
but I better verify that you're doing it
1:23:13 : well because the biggest problem
happens-Is verification supervision?
1:23:16 : Yes, but not overt supervision.
1:23:21 : But verify that it is getting done
to the standards which you are expecting.
1:23:26 : It happens once, it happens
twice, it happens thrice.
1:23:30 : Then you are relatively confident it will
happen again and it will be consistent.
1:23:34 : It is sustainable.
1:23:36 : Trust but verifies an important
principle of leadership.
1:23:41 : Fantastic.
1:23:42 : Now, the follow-through on that is you
made another statement
1:23:47 : when we were chatting offline.
1:23:50 : You said that though a leader is able to
1:23:55 : make dramatic changes in organisation,
1:23:58 : which somebody like you,
you could not then mask from one unit,
1:24:03 : you could not mask it across a larger
group because every
1:24:06 : leader has a personality.
1:24:09 : Now, I will leave it
to you to give the wisdom.
1:24:12 : I don't want to edit what you said.
Yeah.
1:24:16 : See,
in organisations, ultimately, we all have
1:24:21 : to know at what weight are we punching.
1:24:24 : If I'm in an appointment wherein I'm
in charge and influencing 100 I can
1:24:31 : guarantee change in a hundred people.
1:24:34 : Is this scalable?
1:24:35 : Is it replicable?
1:24:36 : Yes, it is scalable and replicable.
1:24:38 : But for that to be guaranteed,
you have to put another hundred under me.
1:24:43 : Correct.
Right?
1:24:44 : I should have oversight and complete
authority to get that done.
1:24:49 : But in most organisations, till that time,
you reach an effects position.
1:24:53 : That is not possible.
1:24:55 : And human emotions come into play.
1:24:58 : Human egos come into play.
1:25:00 : Human personalities
and perceptions come into play.
1:25:04 : While my system may work for me,
somebody else may feel this is overrated.
1:25:10 : It is hyped because he's
not experiencing it.
1:25:13 : It's a lateral position.
Who is he?
1:25:15 : Who is he to?
1:25:16 : And they view it as probably
undermining my originality.
1:25:21 : Or a threat.
Threat to them.
1:25:22 : A lot of times.
1:25:23 : But the right-minded ones,
if you ask me as an individual,
1:25:27 : if something is working somewhere else,
I'll be too happy It's not
1:25:30 : going to be too replicated.
Don't you think so?
1:25:31 : That's common sense, no?
Because it's worked there.
1:25:33 : I agree with you.
I agree.
1:25:35 : I just try it out.
I agree with you.
1:25:37 : I just try it out and see.
1:25:38 : Because eventually, if
you have nothing to do with yourself
1:25:42 : but the larger group,
you are looking at better efficiency,
1:25:45 : better safety, better whatever.
1:25:47 : Then I think it is
but natural for you to do it.
1:25:50 : Actually, it is natural,
I mean, unnatural not to do it.
1:25:53 : Exactly.
1:25:54 : I think that's the message we want to give
the leadership when you have multiple
1:25:58 : leaders in the organisation is,
Don't let egos come in the way
1:26:02 : of the larger organisation growth because
the organisation ethos is
1:26:06 : bigger than your personal stuff.
1:26:08 : They always say, what is it?
1:26:10 : Country comes first,
this one comes next, you come last.
1:26:13 : Absolutely, every time.
Every time.
1:26:15 : Chet Woodian moto.
1:26:16 : Oh, I didn't know it.
1:26:17 : That's the Chet Woodian moto.
1:26:19 : I think that's where we
get that whole thing from.
1:26:24 : The thing is these are
best practises, right?
1:26:28 : Best practises.
1:26:29 : Now, the best practises should
be adopted without hesitation.
1:26:33 : I agree.
1:26:34 : Try it out.
1:26:35 : If it doesn't work,
you can adapt it, right?
1:26:37 : Correct.
But you should replicate best practises.
1:26:42 : I agree.
As a first response.
1:26:43 : I think so.
1:26:44 : I think it makes sense,
and that's what Major General Saab is
1:26:47 : telling all of you,
that please use the best practises
1:26:52 : because then you can get there faster.
1:26:54 : That actually, like you said,
makes you save time, energy, effort.
1:27:00 : Efficiencies improve.
Efficiency.
1:27:01 : It's proven.
1:27:02 : Ultimately, we are saying what
works should be replicated.
1:27:05 : It is proven to work.
Absolutely.
1:27:08 : That comes automatically naturally
to the next topic we want to talk
1:27:12 : about is work-life balance.
1:27:15 : Now, you are clearly saying that laziness
is to take a proven model,
1:27:21 : just put it in place because somebody has
done the heavy lifting to figure it out.
1:27:25 : The silliest and simplest thing you can do
is to look at it, adapt it, adopt it,
1:27:29 : modify it, put it in place,
and then do that.
1:27:32 : It may be one-fifth the time.
1:27:33 : Then now you have got a better solution,
and you still have released time
1:27:37 : for yourself and all the cribbing that is
gone with the midnight
1:27:39 : meetings and all of that.
1:27:41 : But yet people don't do that,
and yet they want a work-life balance.
1:27:44 : Now the flavour of the season is this
work-life balance
1:27:48 : of one generation of people saying,
You should work 70-hour
1:27:53 : weeks or 90-hour weeks.
1:27:54 : Other people say, No,
40 hours is too much.
1:27:57 : 38 hours, 37.
5, maybe 0.
1:27:59 : 25.
1:28:01 : They may come down
to seconds after some time.
1:28:03 : I'm not really sure what's happening.
1:28:06 : The L&T chairman made this statement,
Naran Murdi made this statement,
1:28:11 : and there's a lot of back
and forth happening in there.
1:28:14 : Somebody asked me this question,
What do you think, Doc?
1:28:18 : And all those things.
1:28:19 : I said, I've been thinking myself that if
you bring a patient on the weekend,
1:28:24 : should I operate on a Monday
or should I do it immediately?
1:28:28 : Then I was thinking,
I'm going to ask you the question as
1:28:32 : a major general from the army.
1:28:35 : If the Pakistani army comes
in on a Saturday morning,
1:28:38 : will you tell him, Hey, I'm off.
1:28:39 : I'm only 40 hours, weeks,
come back on Monday morning.
1:28:43 : He's the border protected only 9:
00 to 5: 00, 4: 00 days a week?
1:28:46 : How does it work in the army?
1:28:49 : Thankfully,
this question is theoretical
1:28:52 : and hypothetical because the army
and of course,
1:28:55 : the military and the uniform forces don't
have the luxury of a regimented work
1:29:00 : hours of 8 hours, 9 hours, or 12 hours.
You get that, guys.
1:29:03 : It's a 24 by 7 by 365 day
job to product the borders.
1:29:07 : It's 24/7, 365, as you rightly said.
1:29:10 : At the same level of intensity.
Intensity.
1:29:12 : There is no change in it because
the slightest drop can lead
1:29:15 : to compromises, which is unacceptable,
even the slightest
1:29:18 : compromises is unacceptable.
1:29:18 : This is important because there are some
people who have gone
1:29:22 : to the extent of telling that...
1:29:24 : The LNT chairman made an additional
statement saying that he's saying it
1:29:30 : from the context of nation building
because we're in a building mode.
1:29:33 : When you're building more,
you have to put more miles on the ground.
1:29:37 : A couple of people have gone
to the extent of saying, Why now?
1:29:40 : I don't care about the nation.
1:29:42 : Can you imagine?
1:29:44 : Here, Guys are a set of people
who inherently,
1:29:47 : by signing on to get into the armed
forces, have put their life on the line
1:29:52 : to protect a nation so people like us
can sleep well and get what we want.
1:29:57 : You are saying that the
nation is not important?
1:30:01 : Think about it, guys.
1:30:02 : I want to hear it in the comment section.
1:30:04 : Is that really true?
1:30:05 : What happens if the nation
is not there today?
1:30:08 : Wake up, guys.
Smell the coffee.
1:30:10 : Don't act like juvenile imbéciles.
1:30:14 : That's not what we want here.
1:30:16 : We want people to be responsible.
1:30:18 : You work 40 hours, we're okay,
but don't expect 80 hours of salary.
1:30:22 : You produce.
1:30:24 : Don't look at ours.
1:30:25 : I always say in our famous dialogue I
have, operations successful,
1:30:29 : patient We don't want that.
1:30:32 : You do what you want.
1:30:33 : Produce results for us.
1:30:34 : You can send a rocket to the moon
in five days, be my guess.
1:30:38 : Absolutely.
1:30:39 : If you can build this, what is it,
mangali, sitting at home,
1:30:43 : work from home, no problem.
1:30:44 : Other But limit yourself.
Absolutely.
1:30:46 : Don't want to buy an expensive iPhone,
an Audi car, and a luxurious thing.
1:30:50 : And work only 10 hours.
1:30:51 : It's not possible.
1:30:52 : There are some things
which are time-related process.
1:30:54 : No, but the point is very valid.
1:30:56 : Ultimately,
everything is either task-related, it's
1:30:59 : project-related, it is outcome-related.
1:31:02 : If the outcome is met by doing
30 hours, it's good enough.
1:31:08 : Prove it to us.
1:31:08 : If the outcome is met in 20
hours, it's even better.
1:31:11 : If the outcome is done, instantaneously,
you have all the time for yourself.
1:31:14 : If you automate it after
some time, even better.
1:31:17 : The point is not that you have to fill
in 40 hours or 90 hours, or 150.
1:31:21 : We don't want body sitting there.
1:31:23 : The issue is, I read, I think in LinkedIn,
some time ago, on the same,
1:31:28 : this is the flavour of the season.
1:31:30 : There's a lot of discussion happening.
1:31:32 : One lady said in a private sector, she
said that they had mandated so many hours.
1:31:37 : People would while...
It's a banking sector, if I'm not wrong.
1:31:40 : They would while away time
from 11: 00 to 5: 00 doing nothing.
1:31:42 : Then they would sit to work till 8: 00
because they were told you
1:31:44 : have to sit till 8: 00.
You have to sit till 8: 00.
1:31:46 : Now they had nothing to do.
1:31:48 : They would do nothing till 5: 00.
1:31:49 : Ultimately, that work output which they
were looking at was only 4 hours or 5
1:31:53 : hours or whatever, 6 hours or 8 hours.
1:31:56 : They could have very well finished it.
1:31:57 : The management, if it had laid down,
this This is your outcome.
1:32:01 : So ultimately, everything
comes back to organisation.
1:32:05 : Everything comes back
to organisation of work.
1:32:08 : If you have defined outcomes given,
then how can anybody complain or say that
1:32:12 : I will work only this many or that many?
1:32:14 : This is What you are being employed
in this organisation for is
1:32:18 : to give this outcome.
1:32:20 : You have to give this outcome on a weekly,
daily, monthly, yearly basis
1:32:24 : as for the timeline laid down.
1:32:26 : That is going to decide
how many hours you put in.
1:32:29 : And In fact, that lady says that very
well, though you may put in 8 hours,
1:32:34 : if I want career growth, when I go
back home, I try to upskill myself.
1:32:39 : I read job-related things.
1:32:41 : I attend online courses
which are job-related.
1:32:45 : But I don't include it in my 30 hours.
1:32:46 : I'm putting that much
of effort to upskill myself.
1:32:50 : You are devoting time,
which is ultimately-There are people
1:32:52 : who do this in the time
given to do other things.
1:32:56 : Everything has to be
done within that 8 hours.
1:32:59 : Exactly.
1:33:00 : In fact, today, I don't know whether you
read the Times of India today,
1:33:03 : one of the articles on the centre spread.
1:33:07 : There is an article on the quality
of research papers in India.
1:33:12 : No, I missed that.
It's excellent.
1:33:14 : In fact, it relates to the work-life
balance in a symbolic manner.
1:33:19 : Really?
Oh, really?
1:33:20 : This writer, I forget his name.
He's an academic.
1:33:23 : I forget his name.
1:33:24 : He's written that in India, the quality
of research papers are extremely poor.
1:33:30 : Agreed.
1:33:30 : The reason why it's extremely poor is
because universities and colleges have
1:33:35 : laid down a quota of number
of research papers.
1:33:37 : Quantity.
Quantity.
1:33:40 : That is exactly.
1:33:41 : Now you say that you will work 90 hours,
and if you're not contributing anything
1:33:45 : in those 90, then 90
hours counts for nothing.
1:33:47 : It's exactly as the number
of papers which are being produced.
1:33:51 : You produce lesser number
of papers of higher quality.
1:33:54 : That means the output is better.
1:33:56 : Similarly, maybe you're working 50 hours,
but your output It's better
1:34:00 : that 50 hours is enough.
1:34:02 : You don't have to put in that,
and you can devote the other 30 hours
1:34:05 : to upskilling yourself in your time or
looking after your family or
1:34:09 : whatever other interests you have.
1:34:11 : The point in this is,
he says that it has now become a benchmark
1:34:16 : that we have to produce 100 papers.
What is the call?
1:34:19 : Even one worth publishing?
1:34:21 : Do we even see that?
1:34:22 : He said, Nobody sees that.
1:34:23 : That's true because there are so many
national institutes in our field
1:34:26 : which says that per year, you should have
three publications, four publications.
1:34:30 : Some of them, you read
them, it is abysmal.
1:34:33 : There's nothing going
on there in that whole place.
1:34:36 : You wonder, where is
this going to be used?
1:34:38 : Honestly, if you go to some of their
discussions, I tell them, You guys
1:34:42 : are doing intellectual masturbation.
1:34:44 : There's nothing useful coming out of that.
1:34:46 : Because we are on the ground, we
have the ground, the ground is crying.
1:34:51 : Ground needs help.
1:34:53 : Somebody is sitting in an air
condition room on public money.
1:34:56 : If it's their own money, I don't care.
1:34:58 : On public money, I'm producing They're
doing nothing or very little to show.
1:35:03 : Then it becomes very unfair to the whole
process of what is happening.
1:35:06 : But they think they're doing a lot.
1:35:08 : See, I was actually looking at this
time that you said efficiency.
1:35:11 : When I started operating as
a neurosurgeon, as a junior neurosurgeon,
1:35:15 : I would take so much more time to do
a surgery because I'm still making sure.
1:35:18 : They're learning on the job.
Yes.
1:35:19 : But as I start doing more of it,
the confidence comes
1:35:22 : in and the efficiency comes in.
1:35:24 : But yet there is an X
amount of time it takes.
1:35:27 : There are a lot of surgeons who pride
themselves People are doing things fast.
1:35:31 : They think, Oh, one hour.
1:35:33 : I said, Guys, the time is irrelevant.
Do it well.
1:35:38 : Please understand, there's
only so much that you can do.
1:35:40 : In a speed, you can't do more than
because then the mistakes become higher.
1:35:45 : I tell them that.
1:35:46 : There's always that optimal time beyond
which you cannot push it any further.
1:35:50 : Then you see what is happening.
1:35:52 : I think it's very important for people
to understand that work-life
1:35:56 : balance is not a fancy word to use.
1:35:58 : This 40-hour weeks is
not a fancy word to use.
1:36:01 : What is your take on actually the amount
of hours of work in the sense to have
1:36:06 : this so-called work-life balance?
1:36:07 : See, you are also a human being.
1:36:09 : I'm also a human being,
they're also human beings.
1:36:11 : Everybody deserves a work-life balance.
Let's accept.
1:36:15 : Everybody, whether he is
the sweeper on the road or the CEO
1:36:18 : of a company or whatever it is.
1:36:20 : Forget the money, because there are five
things I think every human being needs
1:36:23 : in life: health, happiness,
peace of mind, love, and relationships.
1:36:28 : None of this is why money can buy.
1:36:30 : By having more money in the bank doesn't
mean anything beyond a certain level.
1:36:34 : What is your take on that?
1:36:35 : See, that's a good question.
1:36:37 : I would like to give a personal
take on this for the simple reason.
1:36:41 : Of course, as I said,
we come from a background,
1:36:43 : or rather the military comes
from a background, wherein
1:36:46 : your time is not your time, actually.
1:36:48 : You're on call throughout.
1:36:50 : But let me give you an example.
1:36:53 : I think this whole issue of work-life
balance can be sorted out in case we are
1:36:57 : organised in how we plan
our time as an individual.
1:37:01 : The example which I wish to give is
I have a single daughter.
1:37:05 : I had my daughter late in the sense that
I was, what, 43 or maybe 44 or
1:37:11 : 45 when my daughter was born.
1:37:13 : At that time, I already finished command
of a unit and I was in a sensitive
1:37:17 : staff appointment.
1:37:18 : In a division, I was the Colonel General
staff that is in charge
1:37:21 : of operational planning.
1:37:23 : As everybody knows in the military,
when you are the Colonel General staff
1:37:27 : in a division, it's one of the busiest
appointments you can
1:37:30 : find in the Indian army.
1:37:32 : You have to stay late nights,
you go early mornings.
1:37:35 : There are plannings going on,
operational plannings going on.
1:37:38 : At that time, my daughter was eight
months old or probably nine months old.
1:37:42 : My wife was alone at house.
1:37:43 : You can understand the pressures
which happen on your wife too.
1:37:49 : The emotional.
1:37:50 : In that entire tenure of two years,
I was back home.
1:37:55 : I would be in office at 8: 00.
1:37:57 : I was back home by 2: 30 AM.
1:38:00 : No, 8: 00 in the morning,
I would go to AM, and I would
1:38:03 : back by 2: 30 PM in the afternoon.
1:38:04 : But invariably, the routine was that you
would stay on till about 7:
1:38:10 : 00 at night, 8: 00 at night.
1:38:12 : But the reason I did that was
that I would take my work home.
1:38:18 : Now, if my wife required
a break, she would be out.
1:38:23 : My child would be pottering around there.
1:38:25 : I would be keeping an eye
on her and in between playing.
1:38:27 : But I had my laptop.
1:38:29 : Let's I had to make
an operational presentation.
1:38:32 : I would plan well in advance.
1:38:34 : If that presentation was due 30 days
later, when I would take my work home,
1:38:38 : I would make two slides a day.
1:38:39 : That way, I give it enough time,
I give it enough thought,
1:38:42 : what is the backdrop to it.
1:38:44 : I would calendar my time in a manner
that every work objective which I had was
1:38:51 : stimulated in it, and I
would start early enough.
1:38:54 : And also you had the time
to take care of the babysitter.
1:38:56 : To the child.
My wife had this.
1:38:57 : Now, the balance is extremely critical.
1:39:00 : You should be able to plan
it well in advance.
1:39:03 : Second, you have to have
the competence to do it yourself.
1:39:05 : Or seek help.
1:39:06 : No, if you seek help,
now you're bound to be in office.
1:39:11 : My point in this is you
can dictate flexibility.
1:39:14 : Actually, it's very
interesting what you said.
1:39:16 : The flexibility you get is on competence.
1:39:20 : If you have competence,
you have flexibility in adjusting
1:39:23 : your time as per your requirement.
Very interesting.
1:39:26 : The second thing which I felt was
important, which allowed me
1:39:30 : the flexibility in doing it is,
you are not dependent on what
1:39:33 : you said other people.
1:39:35 : The day you're dependent on other people,
that is the time you have to be
1:39:39 : at a certain place to get
inputs coming from other people.
1:39:42 : The preparatory work-It will come
to competence, skill, and everything else.
1:39:47 : Everything.
1:39:48 : That can decide the ability for you
to juggle time in a manner
1:39:52 : which is to your liking.
And manage the work-life balance.
1:39:55 : When I finish two years,
the best compliment given to me
1:39:59 : by my boss, he was the general
officer commanding.
1:40:01 : He says,
You have never come back to office
1:40:04 : after 2: 30, and your work is top class.
1:40:07 : How do you manage it?
Fantastic.
1:40:09 : What a question.
That is one thing.
1:40:12 : I took that as the best
compliment I could get.
1:40:14 : I managed both responsive so-called life.
1:40:19 : I would take my...
1:40:20 : In fact, as a lighter way,
there was a park in that contonement.
1:40:25 : After I would make two slides, I would
take my daughter and go to that park.
1:40:29 : You would find A lot of officers
from various units going
1:40:32 : to work in the evening.
1:40:33 : Their wives would be walking.
1:40:35 : They would come back and say,
What appointment is he in that he gets
1:40:38 : time to take his daughter to the park
and you're going to office?
1:40:42 : You have to get his appointment.
It becomes a dangerous situation.
1:40:45 : I can imagine.
1:40:46 : You become a risky thing for us.
1:40:49 : That is the thing.
1:40:50 : The point is that you need to have
a certain skill set for you to do that.
1:40:55 : It doesn't matter if you don't have
it initially, you grow the skill set.
1:40:59 : The But the day you are able to grow it,
you are able to balance
1:41:02 : it out rightly also.
1:41:03 : You never compromise
on the organisation delivery.
1:41:05 : You can't compromise.
And your responsibility.
1:41:08 : I think that is key.
1:41:09 : It's not that you have
to give up one for the other.
1:41:12 : You can make both happen
equally efficiently.
1:41:15 : Now, see, at some point,
you will have to come.
1:41:17 : I'm not saying that never...
Yes, there are odd.
1:41:20 : I'm talking about in those two years,
there would be odd days and all
1:41:22 : when I had to go in the-Of course.
That is nothing.
1:41:26 : That is acceptable.
1:41:26 : Even if 50%, 60% of time you get there,
I think it's a great-It's adequate.
1:41:30 : Of course.
That is the point.
1:41:31 : Be flexible enough to compromise
what is an inescapable requirement.
1:41:36 : It's an inescapable requirement.
It is for organisation.
1:41:39 : Good, you should do it.
1:41:40 : Where you have the latitude
to balance it, you balance it.
1:41:44 : So don't be fixated on a specific figure.
1:41:48 : You have to adapt to it.
I think so.
1:41:50 : I think it depends on also what
level you want to play the game.
1:41:55 : Exactly.
1:41:56 : Based on that,
you decide what you want to.
1:41:58 : You can't go to the moon
on a cycle at the end of the day.
1:42:00 : Absolutely.
1:42:01 : In fact, relating to what you said about
your daughter,
1:42:04 : when my daughter was born in 1995,
I was in the peak of my neurosurgery
1:42:08 : trading residency,
and I was doing 140-hour weeks.
1:42:12 : You know how my day was?
1:42:15 : I used to get into hospital
Monday morning, 7: 00.
1:42:18 : I used to come back Tuesday night, 8: 30.
1:42:21 : Wednesday morning, Thursday night,
Friday morning, Saturday night,
1:42:24 : Sunday morning, Monday night.
1:42:26 : Thirty-six hours, alternate day
calls for four and a half years.
1:42:30 : I literally saw my daughter
grow horizontally.
1:42:33 : Because she'd be sleeping both times.
1:42:35 : Literally.
1:42:36 : I would only hear from my wife that he did
like this, she did like this, she made
1:42:40 : this work, she did this, she did that.
1:42:42 : At that time, this was
pre-mobile phone era.
1:42:44 : There It's not even capturing a video
to see would have been one
1:42:47 : hell of an effort to do.
1:42:48 : But that's the way it is.
1:42:51 : Then somewhere I had to make a compromise.
1:42:53 : In 1999,
when I was in my finally a neurosurgery,
1:42:57 : just before my exams,
I asked myself a question,
1:43:00 : what's my future as a neurosurgeon?
1:43:03 : That's when I started looking around
and one of the peer-reviewed journals
1:43:07 : read, released an article,
Divorce Rates Among Doctors.
1:43:10 : Number one was neurosurgeons.
1:43:13 : My wife had been so upset with me
because she hardly would see me.
1:43:17 : My mother would say, You're using
this house as boarding lodging.
1:43:19 : What is going on here?
I'll put a room number on your door.
1:43:22 : You're just coming and dumping old clothes
and taking new clothes
1:43:25 : and going and things like that.
1:43:27 : But that's how ruthless the training was.
1:43:29 : But unless your training is ruthless,
major general, you will
1:43:32 : not have a great career.
1:43:34 : You have to be like,
you can't be so casual going around
1:43:37 : then expect excellence to happen.
1:43:39 : Yeah, exactly.
1:43:40 : Now, this point I would like to tell you,
in my case, it was different.
1:43:43 : The example I gave you probably is a wrong
example because I was relatively in the
1:43:47 : middle seniority of the Indian army.
Because you were a little later.
1:43:50 : Because I married late
and I got a child late.
1:43:53 : Now, suppose I had been a young officer,
probably I would not have got
1:43:56 : this opportunity to adapt my time.
You would have been like me.
1:43:59 : Exactly.
1:43:59 : You would have been like
me seeing it horizontally.
1:44:01 : I would have been like me.
Or the child would have been exactly like.
1:44:02 : Or the child will be somewhere,
you will be somewhere in the bottom post.
1:44:04 : This is one misconstru.
1:44:06 : My example may be the wrong one because
I was at a different stage in that.
1:44:09 : But it doesn't matter.
1:44:10 : But you did still found to have
how to make both things happen.
1:44:13 : Now, this is one message I want to give
to your audience is they should
1:44:17 : marry late and have a child late.
1:44:19 : This is a message I want to give.
I'll give you the reason.
1:44:21 : I have gone through this.
1:44:25 : The reasons are multiple.
1:44:27 : Let me give you the main ones.
1:44:28 : One, you are established in your career,
you know your job well enough,
1:44:33 : and you can manage and juggle your time
to get that specific work-life balance
1:44:37 : you're looking at, the flavour of the
season and the topic under discussion.
1:44:40 : You marry late and you are able to have
a child late, and you have a child late,
1:44:44 : you'll be able to have the right work-life
balance because
1:44:47 : you are in the stage of life.
1:44:49 : Second, you are in that stage of life.
1:44:51 : As you said, I know where I'm heading.
1:44:54 : I know what my priorities are.
1:44:57 : In my job, work and life,
if in my priorities, life is more
1:45:01 : priority, I devote more time to life.
1:45:03 : If work is a greater priority at this
stage of my life, I devote more time there
1:45:07 : because I know
the consequences well enough.
1:45:10 : Lastly, which I think is the most
important is, your maturity is so much
1:45:14 : more in dealing with a child who's young.
1:45:17 : You have so much of time to
allow her or him to grow
1:45:22 : that you are a far better parent.
1:45:26 : The interaction with the
child keeps you young.
1:45:30 : It is win-win from all directions.
1:45:31 : From all sides, it is win-win.
1:45:33 : You should have a child late,
you should marry late.
1:45:36 : Especially so because lifespans
are increasing year by year.
1:45:40 : I think that's one thing people should do.
1:45:43 : I'm going to give you a pushback here.
1:45:45 : I'm going to say exactly the opposite.
1:45:48 : Me and my wife, we were
medical college classmates.
1:45:51 : We were childhood sweethearts.
1:45:53 : We went around from our age of 18 years.
1:45:57 : We got married when we were 25, 26.
1:46:00 : People look at us and say,
You have such old children?
1:46:03 : I said, Yeah, we had child marriage.
1:46:05 : I was joking.
1:46:06 : We had both our children
before our age of 30.
1:46:09 : Interestingly, my wife is
nine months older than me.
1:46:12 : It's like that.
1:46:13 : Then, in fact, Even before
we got married, I asked her.
1:46:16 : She was also a doctor.
She's also a doctor.
1:46:19 : I asked her a very critical question.
1:46:20 : I said, Do you want
to be a full-time doctor?
1:46:23 : She said, Why?
1:46:24 : I said, See, if you want to be a full-time
doctor from day one,
1:46:27 : let's not have children.
1:46:28 : Because let's not put
the children the grandparents.
1:46:30 : It's not neither of our parents' job
to take care of our children.
1:46:33 : If we can't parent our children,
let's not have children.
1:46:36 : She was very different.
1:46:39 : She said, If you give me a chance, I want
to take a break and have the children.
1:46:44 : She slowed down.
1:46:46 : Then we had the children.
1:46:47 : She spent the time with the children.
1:46:49 : She did certain
things on the side just to keep her knife
1:46:52 : sharp on as far as this is concerned.
1:46:55 : Then as the children started growing,
we lived in a joint family.
1:46:58 : I was very clear about that I wanted to
stay with my parents, take care of them.
1:47:02 : We were four generations living at home,
including my grandmother
1:47:06 : who died when she was 93.
1:47:08 : So all upstairs, very strong, seven
individuals at home, seven points of view.
1:47:13 : You know how it works
at the end of the day.
1:47:14 : No two points of view are the same
and everything else is going on.
1:47:17 : But it was a great place to be.
1:47:19 : Once the children started growing,
she started slowly changing the gear.
1:47:24 : Today, we are in a place where they are
on their own and we can do what we want.
1:47:30 : Guys, there are two perspectives to it.
1:47:31 : Majajal saab has a perspective,
Neurasajal has a perspective.
1:47:34 : You choose what you want.
1:47:36 : The bottom line is you have
to find a plan that works for you.
1:47:39 : I will help you and get that.
1:47:41 : If you have family support,
if you have that support,
1:47:45 : In terms of joint family, somebody,
then the choice becomes easier.
1:47:50 : But if you're going to be
alone, then I think my...
1:47:56 : You have a plan A, you have a plan B,
you choose what you want to take.
1:48:00 : Absolutely, I think.
1:48:01 : One last example I'll give you.
1:48:02 : Once my central AC had packed up.
1:48:05 : I spoke to the person I was
renting from, it's packed up.
1:48:08 : He said, Don't worry, I'll send somebody.
My friend is there.
1:48:11 : He runs a HVAC company.
I'll send him.
1:48:14 : This man who came to my house at 11:
00 at night was about 65 years old.
1:48:18 : He runs his own company.
1:48:20 : He comes in and he looks down and he says,
Okay, there is an issue with this part.
1:48:24 : I will change it.
1:48:25 : Then when he opens that unit, he says, I
think this requires a deep
1:48:29 : cleaning and servicing.
1:48:31 : It's at 11: 00 at night, imagine.
1:48:33 : He says, You go to sleep,
I'll finish it and I'll push off.
1:48:35 : I said, No, I would like
to see what you're doing.
1:48:38 : For next two and a half hours, he talked
me through every action he was taking.
1:48:43 : See the passion he had and the interest
and pride he had in his
1:48:48 : ability to do that.
1:48:50 : A 65-year-old man.
At 11: 00 at night.
1:48:52 : At 11: 00 at night.
1:48:53 : He finally finished
at about 2: 00 to 3: 00.
1:48:56 : But he had gone through and he
was as energetic as ever.
1:48:59 : He says, There.
1:49:00 : Now it is fit and it is good enough
to go for a number of more years.
1:49:04 : And that is it.
1:49:05 : That is the pride and ownership if we get
in our own functions,
1:49:11 : then our standards automatically go.
1:49:13 : Coming to a more serious topic.
1:49:16 : You had shared with me
about one of your CEOs who fell in a gorge
1:49:21 : and broke his back.
1:49:24 : I want
to tell our viewers about what happened
1:49:28 : and what's your
What went through your mind at that time.
1:49:34 : What I had shared was we were deployed
on the line of control,
1:49:38 : and it was a commander,
one of my other brigadier rank officer,
1:49:41 : and I was on the operational staff.
1:49:44 : At that time, we used
to call-He's again in Kashmir.
1:49:46 : Absolutely.
1:49:47 : In fact, ahead of Kupvada,
north of Kupvada.
1:49:53 : We call a brigade major.
1:49:55 : Now, I think they call them
because they have upgraded ranks
1:49:59 : general staff officer Grade 1.
1:50:00 : At that time, he used to call
this appointment a brigade major.
1:50:03 : I was a major there,
head of operations of that brigade.
1:50:07 : As I told you earlier, the Indian pose
and the enemy pose are shouting distance.
1:50:14 : 20 metres, some places
less than that also.
1:50:17 : Twenty?
Yeah, 20, 25 metres.
1:50:19 : That's it.
1:50:19 : Because it's a hypothetical
line which is going crazy.
1:50:23 : Even now it must be the same, I suppose.
1:50:25 : Yeah, nothing has changed in that.
That's the same.
1:50:27 : These are on spur lines, on mountain
and various terrain,
1:50:32 : which is difficult terrain.
1:50:33 : This was winters and it
snows heavily there.
1:50:36 : The paths which go on this spur
lines are extremely narrow paths.
1:50:40 : Like god paths.
There are gold paths.
1:50:42 : They are slippery.
Once it snows, it becomes slippery also.
1:50:46 : This was at night time and the commander
was going to visit one of our posts,
1:50:51 : which was about 20 metres
away from the enemy post.
1:50:54 : Generally, what happens is because it
was a moonless night and generally you
1:50:59 : select moonless lights because visibility
is lesser, so your
1:51:01 : movement goes undetected.
1:51:03 : Somebody must have flashed a torch just
to see, I hope we are aligned right.
1:51:07 : The enemy post must have
seen that flash and go off.
1:51:11 : They fired in anticipation.
1:51:13 : Nowhere were they targeting anybody.
1:51:15 : They just fired as a deterrence.
Exactly.
1:51:20 : But when they fire, human tendency is you
rush towards cover.
1:51:24 : I mean, wherever you may be walking, but
you rush forward to try and take cover.
1:51:30 : When he rushed forward, he slipped
and fell, and he fell over 100 metres.
1:51:34 : Wow, 100 metres?
Yeah, down.
1:51:36 : Correction, 100 feet.
1:51:37 : 100 feet down.
1:51:39 : So 30 to 40 metres, I would say.
1:51:41 : But it was extremely
steep over 80 degrees.
1:51:44 : And rugged, probably.
Rugid.
1:51:46 : He broke his back.
1:51:49 : Then it was a real task to evacuate.
1:51:54 : At that time, they knew something is
happening, so intermittent
1:51:56 : firing was going on.
1:51:58 : Finally, he was evacuated
took a number of hours.
1:52:01 : You had to literally
carry him out of that.
1:52:03 : Physically.
1:52:04 : But his spine got transacted in that and
his mobility got permanently affected.
1:52:10 : Loss of limb movements.
1:52:11 : He's in a wheelchair now.
1:52:13 : Yeah, he's in a wheelchair now.
1:52:14 : But extremely positive man, I must say.
1:52:16 : He's so enthusiastic.
1:52:17 : When you meet him, he radiates.
He'd love to meet him.
1:52:20 : Yeah, he radiates.
He'd love to meet him sometime.
1:52:22 : Next time he's in Bangalore,
I will let you know.
1:52:24 : For sure, I would love to meet him.
1:52:26 : Because his son is working here,
so he comes periodically to visit him.
1:52:31 : Perfect.
1:52:32 : But a gentleman, an old-school gentleman,
he radiates positivity throughout.
1:52:38 : But sometimes we always thought that he
would rig in because at that time people
1:52:41 : were saying that developments in your
specialty, neuroscience is happening,
1:52:47 : use of implants,
those will improve mobility and your
1:52:52 : capabilities, but it never happened.
1:52:54 : I think it was cleanly transacted.
1:52:55 : No, I always tell, even now,
even you should not wish a spinal cord
1:53:00 : injury to happen to your worst enemy.
1:53:02 : It's unforgiving.
1:53:04 : It is really unforgiving.
1:53:06 : It's really you cannot tell how bad it is.
1:53:10 : It's really one of the worst
things to happen in neuroscience.
1:53:15 : Nothing gets into the entire spinal
cord is as big as a little finger.
1:53:18 : All the nerves are going
inside this small cable.
1:53:22 : It's just crazy.
Very sad.
1:53:25 : You've had a lot of tough time in that.
1:53:27 : That's why battle hardened as what you
call at the end of the It
1:53:30 : gives you a perspective.
Absolutely.
1:53:33 : Life is real life.
1:53:34 : It's tenuous.
1:53:36 : Things can change overnight.
1:53:38 : No, overnight.
1:53:39 : It's like a next minute.
1:53:40 : The whole- Your career is different.
1:53:43 : He was doing outstandingly well.
1:53:44 : His career is going to go just upwards,
and then it changes by just that instant.
1:53:50 : Correct.
1:53:51 : Then you realise nothing
can be taken for a pleasure.
1:53:54 : One flash light or one fire, whatever
you call it at the end of the day.
1:53:57 : Absolutely.
All that it takes.
1:53:59 : No, That is why you need
to tell this audience.
1:54:01 : I see on Bangalore roads,
half of them not wearing helmets.
1:54:06 : It's ridiculous.
1:54:07 : You are putting your
life at risk for nothing.
1:54:10 : Forget risk.
1:54:11 : Now, suppose you survive, you could
well land up in that a situation.
1:54:15 : It is such foolish risk for what?
1:54:18 : There is no wisdom here.
1:54:20 : I don't know at what
level are they working.
1:54:23 : In fact, I have a very…
1:54:25 : When people work without thinking,
1:54:30 : We always say as a neurosurgeon, I say,
1:54:32 : Don't work at the spinal cord level.
1:54:34 : That reflects.
You think and work.
1:54:38 : You understand that?
1:54:40 : I was telling this to one of my other
neurosurgeons friends
1:54:43 : of mine from Nirmans.
1:54:44 : The end of the spinal cord
is called coda equina.
1:54:46 : It becomes a set of nerves that goes
like a Kauda Iqvana, it's a horse's tail.
1:54:50 : I tell my guys, Don't work
at the Kauda Iqvana level.
1:54:53 : He said, No, no, Sharan,
Kauda Iqvana is not the lowest.
1:54:56 : There's one thing lowered down called
the pudendal nerve, which suppliers
1:54:59 : the urinary bladder and this.
1:55:01 : People are working at that level.
1:55:03 : A lot of people are just going around
with their life not even
1:55:06 : knowing what's happening.
No effort, but maximum results.
1:55:10 : Everybody wants to be the next
Bill Gates, the next Elon Musk.
1:55:14 : In terms of financial wealth.
Everything.
1:55:17 : Wealth, recognition.
1:55:20 : Now that you're raced away,
I must say this.
1:55:24 : When you read about his hands-on
expertise on this, it's amazing.
1:55:28 : He sleeps on the shop floor.
Right.
1:55:30 : And he gives them engineering solutions.
1:55:32 : And these are all high
tech technology companies.
1:55:34 : He gives them engineering solution.
1:55:36 : And three or four companies is running.
Exactly.
1:55:38 : I didn't even know till recently,
there's a company called the Boring Works.
1:55:43 : I didn't even know that.
1:55:44 : Tunnelling.
1:55:46 : And what happened, apparently, it seemed
that he got stuck in a traffic jam.
1:55:50 : He said, To help with this,
I'll make tunnels.
1:55:52 : I mean, amazing guy.
1:55:54 : This is what I read in this boring works.
1:55:57 : One of the employees says that whenever
They have engineering problems because
1:56:01 : these are huge machines
which are going under the Earth.
1:56:04 : So he always comes and attends
the brainstorming, and he comes up
1:56:07 : with unique solutions which are workable.
Interesting.
1:56:10 : So he has the capability to do that.
1:56:13 : If we grow that capability
and desire, it's a good thing.
1:56:16 : But a lot of times, as you said, they
want minimum effort and maximum result.
1:56:20 : It never works like that.
It doesn't work.
1:56:22 : It doesn't work.
Guys, it doesn't work.
1:56:23 : You have to be practical,
you have to be pragmatic, you have to have
1:56:27 : common sense, you have to be practical.
1:56:30 : You have to understand what's going on.
1:56:31 : I think that's the only
way to take it forward.
1:56:34 : Effort is important.
Yes.
1:56:35 : One of the things you said very early
in this one about
1:56:39 : anecdotal data that comes in,
anecdotal experience or information
1:56:43 : that you said comes down to data.
1:56:46 : I know that your new assignment,
you've taken some work on data and AI.
1:56:51 : You have spoken,
you have seen data at different times
1:56:55 : in the armed forces,
and you have tried your own way to build
1:56:58 : the leadership, the science
of organisation building.
1:57:00 : You have shared your wisdom.
1:57:01 : If you have something more to share,
I would definitely want
1:57:03 : to hear that from you.
1:57:04 : You want to share about the science
of organisation building first,
1:57:08 : anything more before you want data?
1:57:10 : Or you want to talk about the data?
1:57:12 : No, the organisation
building is a simple thing.
1:57:17 : There are three things in
organisation changes, not building.
1:57:21 : Building, of course,
everybody will build as long as you have
1:57:23 : the right guardrails in place, developing
the habits from initiation stage.
1:57:29 : Now, the problem Problem is when you enter
an organisation as its leader and its
1:57:33 : routine and habits are set,
and it is not as per what you would
1:57:38 : ideally expect the routine and habits,
now you have to change it.
1:57:42 : That is a more difficult task.
1:57:44 : If you are Still, you're establishing it,
you can always establish it new
1:57:47 : in the footprint you wanted to be in.
1:57:50 : For that, the aspect
in this is experimentation.
1:57:54 : That is extremely important.
1:57:56 : The science of organisational changes,
experimentation.
1:58:00 : You have to have multiple ideas.
1:58:02 : You have no idea which one is going
to work, which one is going to change
1:58:07 : the culture, or it's going
to change the practises.
1:58:10 : That has to happen
through experimentation.
1:58:14 : Which experimentation document is working
and leading to the results
1:58:17 : is identification.
1:58:18 : You should be able to identify
which is the one which is doing it.
1:58:23 : Now for that, you require feedback coming
in, which is objective because people are
1:58:27 : going to tell you what you want to hear.
1:58:29 : If you're the head of an organization-
Sometimes, you don't want to hear also.
1:58:31 : Whatever you want to hear,
they'll tell you.
1:58:33 : I can well understand the problems
the Prime Minister or heads of big
1:58:37 : institutions will be having because
they are surrounded by a circle of people
1:58:42 : who are telling them
what they want to hear.
1:58:44 : Until you break it
and you are able to reach down
1:58:48 : to objective viewpoints
and feedbacks coming back.
1:58:51 : The truth.
You are coming back to your truth.
1:58:52 : Exactly.
Unwarnished.
1:58:54 : You are never going to know what is
actually working or what
1:58:58 : is actually happening.
1:58:59 : Now, in this identification,
one thing is extremely important,
1:59:02 : that is survivability.
1:59:04 : That is when you experiment, you can't
experiment with the full organisation.
1:59:09 : Let's say that experiment fails,
the organisation collapses.
1:59:11 : It crashed, correct.
1:59:12 : So your experimentation has to be at that
scale that its failure is survivable.
1:59:18 : That means a microcosm of the
organisation, you have to test it.
1:59:21 : The experimentation has
to happen in a small subset.
1:59:25 : Which represents the company,
a small version of the company.
1:59:27 : Try whether it's working there,
because if it fails, it fails.
1:59:30 : You revert back to the rest
of the organisation.
1:59:33 : But it doesn't impact the organisation.
1:59:34 : Once that survivability and feedback is
established and you know what succeeds,
1:59:38 : then it's scalability.
1:59:39 : Now you proliferate it across
the organisation and give it your entire
1:59:45 : support to ensure that it succeeds
because now you're sure what works.
1:59:49 : That is the nuts and bolts
of organisational change,
1:59:54 : and it functions in that manner.
1:59:56 : But data, I'm a fan of data for the simple
reason That in the army,
2:00:02 : the decision making is anecdotal.
2:00:04 : Everywhere, even in our medicine,
a lot of it is anecdotal.
2:00:07 : I follow what I've seen.
2:00:09 : I apply my mind, okay,
in my circumstances,
2:00:12 : I'll have to change it like this.
2:00:13 : But to my mind, I think there has to be
a balance of intuitive decision making,
2:00:18 : which intuition comes with experience.
2:00:20 : How can you have intuition if you're
not been through that situation before?
2:00:23 : It can't come out of a dream.
2:00:25 : The intuition comes in because you have
been through a situation which is
2:00:28 : like that or similar to that.
2:00:30 : It's intuitive come data-driven
or empirical decision making.
2:00:36 : Data-driven decision making has to give
you support to the decision, has to give
2:00:41 : the support to the decision you take.
2:00:43 : For example, if I give you in my army
2:00:45 : parlance, just if let's say X number,
2:00:50 : let's say a thousand troops are committed
2:00:53 : in 1,000 square metres or kilometres
2:00:58 : of an area, and it is terrorist infested.
2:01:02 : There are a lot of terrorists there.
2:01:03 : I find that I need to increase
the density of people.
2:01:07 : I make it 3000.
2:01:09 : How do I know whether this is working or
not in my overall aim of eliminating
2:01:15 : terrorism from that area.
2:01:17 : One way of doing that is that
we are eliminating terrorists.
2:01:22 : They should be good enough.
2:01:23 : More number of people, the better it is,
because that is the conventional
2:01:26 : wisdom which says it.
2:01:27 : The other way of looking at it is when I
had I have 1,000 people, in a year,
2:01:31 : I killed or eliminated 100 terrorists.
2:01:35 : I have now 3,000 people.
2:01:37 : I have eliminated 120 terrorists.
2:01:41 : It hasn't made a marginal difference.
2:01:42 : With a three-fold increase in troops,
you haven't- Only 20.
2:01:46 : That means either your initial data is
wrong, that the number of the density
2:01:52 : of inimical presence there is lesser,
or your probably placement
2:01:58 : of people is not right.
2:02:00 : Or the people are not right.
2:02:01 : Or the people are not right.
2:02:03 : We take that as a constant.
You take a constant.
2:02:05 : I take that as a constant.
2:02:06 : That's the important thing.
2:02:07 : You're clear that-I
take a second constant.
2:02:09 : Yeah, got it.
2:02:10 : Now, I try again by redeploying them
into maybe the initial assessment of area
2:02:15 : where there is the initial density
of where there is different.
2:02:19 : Now I move them separately.
2:02:20 : Now I check again after six months.
2:02:22 : If there is a wide variance
in data, maybe I'm done.
2:02:25 : Now, if there is no change in data,
then putting more troops has no meaning.
2:02:29 : Now the decision I have to take is pull
them out because it is now data-driven.
2:02:32 : Correct.
2:02:33 : And how many to pull out?
How many to pull?
2:02:35 : No, it is based on some facts.
2:02:37 : It is not based on a feeling.
2:02:39 : It is not based on somebody's perception.
2:02:43 : That is my point when I say
that data-driven decision-making.
2:02:46 : Data-driven decision-making.
Decision-making.
2:02:47 : Very true.
2:02:48 : Again, it has to be taught through is
my view on this because it
2:02:52 : doesn't come naturally to us.
Very true.
2:02:54 : Because you're so close to your heart,
you joined this AI company.
2:02:59 : It's a good company.
2:03:00 : Let me advertise them
in this-Yes, why not?
2:03:03 : He's a Bangalore boy.
2:03:05 : The CEO is a Bangalore-based individual.
2:03:08 : What's the name?
Vikram Jairam.
2:03:12 : He's US-based.
He started his company.
2:03:14 : He says, This is a He's
a fascinating company.
2:03:15 : He's done his PhD abroad
in AI and all that.
2:03:18 : He's US-based or he's Bangalore-based?
No, he's US-based.
2:03:20 : Of course, Bangalore.
2:03:22 : Studied in Belgam, if I'm not
wrong, engineering college.
2:03:27 : Then did his master's in the US
and continued working there.
2:03:30 : Now he's over 40.
2:03:31 : He's working for some time there.
2:03:34 : Both his wife is also from Bangalore,
and both of them are engineers.
2:03:39 : Both of them working there.
2:03:41 : He was working with ExxonMobil,
the oil company.
2:03:44 : Then he quit that and now
he established this neuralx.
2:03:50 : Ai there and they have
an India branch in Bangalow.
2:03:54 : But the mother company is in US,
which he's the CEO of.
2:04:02 : Their main competency is multiple sensor
fusion or data coming from multiple
2:04:08 : sensors to fuse it, to interpret it, make
sense of it, and then predict outcomes.
2:04:15 : Especially in the oil industry,
he gave me a book.
2:04:20 : It's amazing.
It's called The New Path.
2:04:22 : He's author of the book?
2:04:23 : No, he presented it to me.
2:04:25 : It's by an American author,
but it's an outstanding book.
2:04:29 : It gives you I had no idea.
2:04:32 : The new path?
The new path.
2:04:33 : It shows you as to how the changes
in energy dependency is shaping
2:04:39 : geo strategic alignments globally.
2:04:43 : Energy means the gas,
petrol, and- Shale oil.
2:04:46 : Shale oil.
Mainly shale oil.
2:04:48 : Shale oil and shale gas has changed
the entire dynamic of global alignments.
2:04:54 : In fact,
Russia, Ukraine war,
2:04:59 : and so many other conflicts, the
reduction of the importance
2:05:05 : of the Middle East from an energy
perspective, all that is borne out
2:05:08 : of the US becoming energy independent,
primarily because of shale oil
2:05:15 : revolution which has happened.
2:05:17 : His work, a lot of this AI is on because
shale oil is a complex process.
2:05:22 : It's not an easy process.
2:05:24 : It was quite expensive.
2:05:25 : Now they have made it cheaper.
2:05:27 : Because the technologies to it.
2:05:29 : But even now there It
has a break-even price.
2:05:31 : Even now it happens, but it has
a lot of impact, attendant impact.
2:05:35 : A lot of states in the US itself
have banned it for multiple reasons.
2:05:41 : But whatever said and done,
it has given them independence in energy,
2:05:46 : which has dictated that thought process
in geo strategic alignments
2:05:50 : and partnerships and foreign policy.
2:05:53 : It's a fascinating book.
2:05:56 : He does a lot of AI work there.
2:05:58 : But here in India, we are into both AI
and organisations as also manufacturing.
2:06:06 : Every process can be made more efficient
if the data is interpreted rightly.
2:06:12 : First, you need to have sensors,
sensors with measured data,
2:06:15 : data which gets fed into a processing unit
and a processing unit which can make sense
2:06:21 : of it and throw out
conclusions and deductions.
2:06:25 : It's a great field.
2:06:27 : I think nothing to make you,
if this is today's domain, it is good
2:06:30 : to be involved in today's technology.
2:06:32 : Everybody is talking AI right now.
Yeah, exactly.
2:06:35 : Starting with the Prime Minister,
everybody is talking about it.
2:06:39 : I think it's a great tool.
2:06:41 : I think India has actually, when I look at
the digitization which has happened,
2:06:47 : who would have thought you have direct
beneficiary transfers
2:06:50 : happening into your account?
The UPI is amazing.
2:06:52 : Upi is, you know?
2:06:53 : You can pay anywhere with carrying no
money with you, with your phone,
2:06:55 : just with your phone.
Amazing.
2:06:58 : Any amount of money,
even one rupee, you can pay.
2:07:00 : To the extent that the beggers
who have UBI QR code.
2:07:03 : When you say, I'm not carrying change.
2:07:05 : I remember that guy who comes with that
Bullock home, that bullock at the QR code.
2:07:11 : It's amazing.
2:07:13 : But I don't think any other
country has it like that.
2:07:15 : No, nobody.
The denervation is so India-specific.
2:07:19 : But it has really made ease
of payments so much more easy.
2:07:23 : And it's democratised payment.
2:07:24 : Because it's not that only the big
shops have this one, the plastic money.
2:07:28 : Everybody has the same.
2:07:29 : Everybody has the same QR It's
a same code, the same thing.
2:07:30 : That's what it's democratising all about.
2:07:32 : Then it becomes affordable to people,
and then the equitable
2:07:36 : wealth distribution happens.
2:07:37 : Then everybody has a piece of the pie.
2:07:39 : To the extent that recently there was
a Panipuri fellow who got a notice
2:07:43 : from the GST and the Government of India
because he had got 40 likes
2:07:46 : into his account through UPI.
2:07:47 : Panipuri fellow, what's going on, buddy?
2:07:50 : You got 40 likes, you better pay some tax.
You pay zero tax.
2:07:53 : Yeah, you better pay some tax.
But that's a good thing.
2:07:55 : Everybody becomes
on board and contributing.
2:07:57 : You are mainstreaming the economy
and You're getting all the stuff out.
2:08:02 : It's crazy, but that's the way it is.
2:08:05 : I think we had a great chat.
2:08:08 : Let me be honest about it.
I think you're lovely.
2:08:10 : Pleasure's all mine, really.
2:08:11 : As we wind down,
is there any last messages that you want
2:08:16 : to give the audience, the global
viewers from your side, anything?
2:08:20 : Do it personal.
2:08:22 : There's anything that you want to say.
2:08:24 : The point is we are not developing
students with a critical
2:08:30 : critical thinking ability.
2:08:32 : Of course, the NEP now
plans to foster this by changing
2:08:36 : the methodologies and the curriculum.
2:08:39 : It is not an easy thing to do.
2:08:41 : It is because the problem which we have
been facing and the institutions we have
2:08:45 : been running is you ultimately
have to train the trainer.
2:08:49 : The teachers have to get trained the right
way that they're able
2:08:52 : to impart the right way.
2:08:53 : Even now, if you say, even today,
when everybody's talking about critical
2:08:59 : thinking, Everybody is talking about your
ability to be creative, problem
2:09:04 : solving abilities and all that.
2:09:06 : Even now, if you still in a classroom,
even in one of the leading schools,
2:09:10 : no, this is the way it is done.
2:09:12 : You can't do it that way because
I don't know how that is done.
2:09:16 : That response is not today.
2:09:20 : In fact, it was not of yesterday also.
2:09:22 : But those responses are common.
2:09:24 : The teachers need to be skilled.
2:09:26 : This is one thing which
people have to put in.
2:09:28 : Yes, you need to make incentivise
it more because they are critical.
2:09:32 : If you have a demographic dividend today,
the demographic dividend is only going
2:09:37 : to bear fruit if the demography is killed.
Correct.
2:09:41 : If the demography is not skilled,
it's not going to bear fruit.
2:09:43 : It's just body is there.
Absolutely.
2:09:45 : That is going to create more harm.
2:09:47 : Problem, yes, agreed.
2:09:48 : For that, then the teacher's
job is critical.
2:09:51 : You have to incentivize it.
2:09:53 : But to ensure that the teacher is
delivering the right way,
2:09:56 : we have to revamp probably
teacher training institutes.
2:09:59 : I I think we have
to reboot the whole system.
2:10:01 : Absolutely.
I think we didn't touch upon this.
2:10:04 : We should go and touch upon this.
2:10:05 : You said two things at that time
when we spoke about education.
2:10:08 : One is the Japanese way of
training their children.
2:10:13 : The second one is you're posting
as a defence attachee in the US.
2:10:16 : I think we should talk
about this for sure.
2:10:18 : First, about the Japanese,
you said something very critical,
2:10:21 : and I love Japanese way of doing it.
I spent six months there.
2:10:24 : I'm a fida of the way they do it.
2:10:26 : Tell us about that.
2:10:29 : That I found even in the...
2:10:30 : See, my daughter was in primary when
I was a defence attachee in the US.
2:10:33 : I saw their public school
system at close quarters.
2:10:36 : The Indian government looks
after its diplomats very well.
2:10:39 : Probably they look after the Indian
government looks after its diplomats
2:10:42 : better than any other
country in the world.
2:10:44 : I must say this.
2:10:45 : It gives you the opportunity to stay
in the best place in the host
2:10:49 : country where you are a diplomat in.
2:10:51 : Because when I go as a defence attache,
I go on a diplomatic status.
2:10:54 : The government pays for where I'm staying.
2:10:57 : The government pays the rent and the rent
levels are such that you go into the best
2:11:02 : neighbourhoods of that host country.
2:11:04 : We were staying in one of the best
neighbourhoods of the host country.
2:11:07 : My daughter was privileged enough
to attend a public school
2:11:11 : in the best neighbourhood.
2:11:12 : You knew you could see the primary school
education system at close quarters.
2:11:19 : Even there, but as far as the issue is,
they teach them things
2:11:23 : which are critical at primary.
2:11:25 : They don't burden them with subjects
which don't have much value at that stage.
2:11:31 : Ultimately, what do you
want a child to develop?
2:11:34 : You require a child to develop the ability
to think independently through
2:11:40 : building blocks of logic and outcomes.
2:11:44 : Number two, you require a child
to be able to communicate it well.
2:11:48 : Correct.
Effectively.
2:11:49 : Effectively.
2:11:50 : What are the two critical
needs a child has?
2:11:52 : The ability to think,
the ability to communicate.
2:11:55 : In the primary school education,
they only concentrate on this.
2:11:59 : Interesting.
2:12:00 : So much so, this is for your viewers,
one day my daughter, she was in Grade 3,
2:12:04 : I think at that time.
2:12:06 : She comes home with a worksheet,
math worksheet, which says F-O-U-R
2:12:13 : plus F-O-U-R, written in alphabet,
2:12:15 : F-O-U-R plus F-O-U-R gives you E-I-G-H-T.
2:12:21 : If every alphabet
represents a unique number between zero
2:12:27 : to nine, find all possible combinations.
2:12:30 : Wow, this is a child of Grade 3.
2:12:33 : She came and handed it over to me.
2:12:36 : I had no idea what to do with it.
2:12:38 : I googled it.
2:12:40 : At that time, there was, thankfully,
I mean, regrettably no ChatGPT.
2:12:45 : I googled it.
2:12:46 : Finally, out of trial and error,
I found out these solutions.
2:12:50 : It's primarily a logic-based
trial and error solution.
2:12:53 : Got it.
2:12:53 : By elimination, you use elimination
to see what fits, what doesn't fit.
2:12:58 : Got it.
2:13:01 : The thing is once I did that,
I got the various combinations.
2:13:06 : And next day, when I was dropping her
to school, I went and met the math
2:13:10 : teacher and I said, I mean, this is no
question to give a child in Grade 3.
2:13:15 : He says, Sir, we are not
interested in her solving it.
2:13:19 : We are only wanting her to go through
the process of logical elimination.
2:13:24 : Let train her to think logically.
2:13:27 : Yes, if this happens and this happens,
logically, this should happen.
2:13:31 : If this happens and this happens,
logically, this should not be happening.
2:13:36 : Or this cannot happen.
2:13:37 : It is a critical thinking ability.
2:13:40 : You're basing it on sound factors.
2:13:45 : They're not too
formula-ridden in anything.
2:13:49 : By the way, at that time in the embassy,
he's still in the diplomatic community,
2:13:55 : so I will not take his name.
2:13:56 : He was a master's in math,
and he's an IFS officer.
2:14:02 : Next day, when I went to office,
I took this worksheet and I gave it to him
2:14:05 : and I told him, Can you solve this?
2:14:07 : Because I had done it
through trial and error.
2:14:09 : I said, Can you solve this?
2:14:11 : After about half a day comes to my office,
he says, Sir, I have tried various.
2:14:14 : He's showing me multiple formulas,
and none of the formulas fit.
2:14:19 : A master's in math, even now,
is process-bound in trying formulas.
2:14:25 : He is not looking at the
foundations of that problem.
2:14:29 : That shows that- Which is what?
2:14:31 : Because of which he failed to solve.
Failed to solve it.
2:14:33 : That is what is the problem
with our education system.
2:14:36 : Somebody whom you would think that should
be able to do advanced math easily,
2:14:40 : but advanced math to do that, you better
know what are the building blocks.
2:14:44 : If you If you're not able to identify
the building blocks, even after having
2:14:47 : done that, then it shows the flaws.
2:14:49 : I think this is actually what as you're
saying, I'm thinking
2:14:53 : that's why Indians are so bad
in innovation, but so
2:14:56 : good in service industry.
2:14:58 : And so good in replicating something.
2:15:00 : There's one somebody gives it to you.
2:15:01 : You're just able to do it.
2:15:03 : But you're not able to think
because you need a framework.
2:15:05 : You can't create your own framework.
2:15:07 : Our identification strategy should say
that our system is failing because of,
2:15:12 : let's say, our teacher
competence need to be improved.
2:15:15 : The foundation of our education
needs a radical change.
2:15:19 : Then we are able to produce
the right people.
2:15:20 : Rebooting.
Rebooting.
2:15:22 : The same thing with the Japanese
teach you social skills.
2:15:28 : I know there was some time ago,
Who would have also seen it?
2:15:31 : In LinkedIn, a video was floating around.
Of the kid.
2:15:33 : Kid, right?
On the bus.
2:15:35 : You saw that?
You can tell they are.
2:15:37 : We'll find that.
2:15:38 : They showed in a classroom in Japan,
again, a primary, I think it would
2:15:42 : have been grade two or something.
2:15:44 : The whole class is organised like a bus.
2:15:46 : That means one desk in front who's
a driver and the seats behind.
2:15:51 : They show a child coming
in with a beard and a walking stick.
2:15:54 : That means an elderly one coming in.
2:15:56 : As soon as that person walks in,
one of the child from a desk
2:16:00 : up and offers the seat.
2:16:01 : They are bringing in social skills and
social sensitivity from a very young age.
2:16:07 : Let's say we do that about traffic rules,
you'll find that none of our
2:16:10 : people will be breaking red lights.
Correct.
2:16:12 : Absolutely.
2:16:13 : These are the things we need to
concentrate on in foundational education.
2:16:17 : But if you come to India, the schools now,
all the parents are
2:16:20 : breaking all the rules.
2:16:21 : And so the next generation is
being taught that by the father.
2:16:24 : Absolutely.
2:16:25 : He's dropping on the
median here sometimes.
2:16:27 : Can you imagine?
2:16:29 : Or sometimes Because they're sitting
behind and making them drive the scooter.
2:16:32 : I mean, come on, guys, wake up.
Yeah.
2:16:35 : So these are things which I think
ultimately, because every time we say we
2:16:39 : have such a large youth population,
it's of no use unless you train.
2:16:44 : Quality is important than quantity.
2:16:45 : Quality is important.
2:16:46 : That is my first message.
2:16:48 : Second message, again,
is on foundational skills.
2:16:51 : There is a person called James Hackman.
2:16:53 : I read in Times of India, again,
many months ago, in some research of his,
2:16:59 : which is over a 40-year period,
which I have quoted many times
2:17:04 : to the schools and institutes which were
under me in my last appointment,
2:17:08 : that they tracked people over 40 years.
2:17:12 : This research has a- Who was it?
2:17:15 : This individual, James Heckman and his
team, tracked people over 40 years.
2:17:20 : Basic premise or the questioning was,
what dictates how much
2:17:26 : you earn in later life?
2:17:30 : You'd be surprised to know that 80%
of your earning capability,
2:17:35 : which is equated to success in society,
is dictated not by your IQ,
2:17:40 : not by your education levels.
2:17:43 : It is dictated by your
foundational personal skills
2:17:47 : of discipline, resilience,
perseverance, ability to take rejection.
2:17:52 : Those are things which- Really?
Yes.
2:17:54 : He said 80%.
2:17:56 : It is not a small number.
2:17:58 : Of course, it's a serious number.
2:18:00 : If everything is going to be decided
by your foundational skills,
2:18:03 : then our school should be
concentrating at the primary.
2:18:05 : My theory is- What are the four?
2:18:07 : Can you please repeat the four again?
2:18:09 : Discipline, self-discipline.
2:18:11 : The ability to regulate your
activities to a greater good.
2:18:15 : Resilience, the ability
to withstand shocks.
2:18:18 : Perseverance, though you fail,
you keep- Keep at it.
2:18:23 : And robustness,
robustness to take setbacks.
2:18:28 : My My theory, I spoke at some time ago
when the NEP, there was
2:18:34 : a CBSE conference here.
2:18:35 : At that time, I was in uniform and running
responsible for some schools.
2:18:40 : In that, I said, My personal theory,
if you ask me is,
2:18:44 : till primary level, Class 5, 70%
of our emphasis should be on foundational
2:18:51 : skills to build these qualities.
2:18:53 : Foundational in this,
I would include even social skills.
2:18:56 : To be a productive member of society.
2:18:58 : If you are breaking a red light,
you're not a productive member of society.
2:19:01 : You're a destructive member.
2:19:02 : If you're not following the laws which we
have committed as a community to live
2:19:07 : under and you're not following that,
you're again not a productive
2:19:09 : member of society.
2:19:11 : The simple thing is standing in the queue.
2:19:12 : You're standing to buy something,
somebody comes in front It
2:19:15 : takes it as a matter of right.
2:19:16 : Just because you have said nothing,
he wants to come in front.
2:19:18 : He doesn't even think he's doing it wrong.
2:19:21 : These are skills, 70% up to primary,
you should do it, and 30% of it should be
2:19:26 : based on critical thinking
and communication.
2:19:30 : As you go to fifth to ninth,
you can now reduce the found,
2:19:34 : because hopefully you should have
developed some amount
2:19:36 : of foundational skills.
2:19:37 : Reduce that to 30,
bring down your critical thinking
2:19:41 : and communication to another 30, 60,
and now bring in the traditional subjects.
2:19:47 : Social sciences, sciences,
because now you are better capable
2:19:51 : of absorbing and assimilating that.
2:19:53 : There is no sense in spending nine years.
2:19:55 : Today's newspaper says it, Our grade five,
class five and class six
2:20:00 : read at class two level.
Really?
2:20:02 : Today's Times of India has this article.
My goodness.
2:20:05 : But simply some sine theta, cos theta,
the teacher, something which is
2:20:08 : not even relevant to them.
Absolutely.
2:20:10 : If you can't understand what it even leads
to, then what is the use of doing that.
2:20:17 : Now as you go to higher, let's say,
beyond ninth, this is the time you want
2:20:21 : to build the right base for them,
undergrad and post-grad.
2:20:24 : Now you ramp up
science and maths and whichever arts
2:20:29 : and humanities, the specific subject,
to 70% and reduce foundational skills
2:20:35 : to 10, reduce come, because by now,
those issues should have got built.
2:20:38 : It has to be more adaptable.
2:20:40 : How can it be a single one
from class 1 to class 12?
2:20:43 : Unless we oriented like that,
you are never, ever going to- Have you
2:20:47 : given this feedback to the
government or to the UGC?
2:20:50 : It is my personal view.
2:20:53 : But they keep asking for feedback.
2:20:55 : Why don't you write it
and give it to them?
2:20:56 : I think you're sounding very
it's common sense to us.
2:21:00 : To my mind,
they should take three schools and try.
2:21:03 : Exactly as I said, organisational
change, they should try it out.
2:21:07 : Take that sample size.
2:21:08 : You will get that sample size in six
years, five years, four years, and then
2:21:12 : see whether it's effective or not.
2:21:14 : No, but if it's working in Japan,
working in US, I think they should close
2:21:17 : their eyes and look at how
to adapt it to Indian countries.
2:21:19 : Absolutely.
2:21:20 : Because we are seeing them successful as
the economies and there's
2:21:22 : no debate on that fact.
Exactly.
2:21:24 : I don't think- Every innovation
which they do is a functional innovation.
2:21:28 : We didn't talk about
Functional innovations.
2:21:30 : In the US, I see innovation,
which I saw in those three years.
2:21:34 : If I'm doing something,
the changes and the innovations which are
2:21:41 : happened is something which is
happening on daily life.
2:21:43 : Now,
if I'm finding it a problem to knock
2:21:45 : a nail in the wall and hang a painting,
so they get in with that vacuum thing.
2:21:49 : You are able to now attach
anything on the wall.
2:21:52 : That's a functional innovation.
2:21:54 : I am hard-pressed to name one functional
innovation which has come from India.
2:22:00 : Malaga.
One thing I can name which- UPI.
2:22:03 : No, not UPI, of course.
2:22:04 : Yes, that's digital.
2:22:05 : No, one mechanical function is,
you're seen in these marriages,
2:22:09 : those big fans with throw water.
2:22:12 : I'm not seeing it anywhere else.
2:22:15 : That is a scented water.
2:22:17 : Huge fans when there's no AC.
2:22:20 : That I'm not seeing anywhere else.
2:22:22 : I presume that's a mechanical
functional innovation.
2:22:26 : See, the bureaucracy has to be trained
in making changes in all of it.
2:22:30 : How can an education ministry not have
people who are trained to identify
2:22:33 : these and make changes?
You have to get people like that.
2:22:37 : It has to happen fast.
We can't wait for it for 20 years.
2:22:39 : If you wait, you're lost.
2:22:40 : We are lost in a lot of opportunity.
Absolutely.
2:22:42 : I think this is the literally next 30,
40 years, It has to change
2:22:45 : now for that impact.
Absolutely.
2:22:47 : You also made a very interesting comment
as connected to the US,
2:22:50 : every house has a, what is that?
2:22:52 : A workshop or something.
Oh, right.
2:22:55 : No, there are two other
things in the US which I saw.
2:22:57 : Their ability to foster the feeling
of nationhood is not,
2:23:04 : what should I say, overt.
2:23:06 : It's very subtle.
2:23:07 : In the morning, the school raises a flag.
Every day?
2:23:11 : Yeah, every day.
2:23:12 : The children raise a flag.
2:23:14 : The American flag is
raised in that school.
2:23:17 : There is no central assembly and all.
2:23:19 : They go to the classroom
and they sing their anthem.
2:23:22 : Every day?
Every day.
2:23:23 : It's done every day.
My goodness.
2:23:26 : The NBA matches, basketball matches,
there are 82 matches.
2:23:29 : A team plays one team.
2:23:30 : There are 30 teams which play.
2:23:32 : 2000 matches of the totally.
2:23:33 : I was reading that.
2:23:36 : Similarly, NFL.
2:23:37 : In every match, they troupe out the flag.
2:23:41 : The National Guard uniform,
people get the flag.
2:23:43 : The flag is raised.
2:23:44 : People from the audience,
they select a particular school,
2:23:47 : a particular person to sing the anthem.
2:23:49 : The anthem is song.
The respect is...
2:23:51 : And only then the match starts.
2:23:52 : Nobody finds it MS.
Amazing.
2:23:54 : Everybody participates in it.
2:23:56 : No wonder that feeling
of Nation First is so high.
2:23:59 : There's a single name.
2:23:59 : You see All the museums
in Washington DC, entry is free.
2:24:03 : You can't get a better class of museums.
Why?
2:24:06 : Because there is private money
which comes and maintains it.
2:24:09 : For all schools, the entrance is free.
2:24:11 : They take the children on school trips,
ride from a young age.
2:24:15 : They show them.
2:24:16 : It is done up so well,
American History Museum, the Space Museum,
2:24:20 : aerospace and Space Museum,
the Natural History Museum.
2:24:24 : These are all free entries.
2:24:25 : There is private benefactors who ensure it
is maintained at the
2:24:31 : It's excellent in terms of the
quality of display, the acoustics,
2:24:37 : the graphics of it, the experience
itself is a memorable experience.
2:24:44 : That is now built in slowly.
Nobody finds it imposed.
2:24:47 : Correct.
Or in the face.
2:24:48 : In the face.
2:24:49 : It comes in as a natural course
of the rhythm of your life.
2:24:54 : Got it.
In the rhythm of life you're taken.
2:24:56 : Now, uniform, Arlington Cemetery,
if you go in, you have the
2:25:00 : The tomb of the unknown soldier.
2:25:02 : There is a 24-hour guard on it.
2:25:04 : And that guard marches and protects
the tomb of the unknown soldier.
2:25:07 : It doesn't matter what is the weather.
2:25:10 : It could be raining, snowing,
but the guard isn't open.
2:25:12 : There is no shelter.
2:25:13 : He is marching in the It's
not going to happen.
2:25:15 : I gave you that example.
2:25:17 : Some time ago, I don't know how many
decades ago, there was a huge storm there,
2:25:20 : prediction, and they
said you have to go in.
2:25:22 : They refused.
2:25:23 : They said this is the tomb
of the unknown soldier.
2:25:26 : It will be guarded irrespective
of what weather emergencies there are.
2:25:31 : This is not going to be vacated.
2:25:32 : And they remained there.
2:25:34 : Now, when you talk about culture,
these actions build culture.
2:25:38 : Ethos get built by what is
not- Nationalistic culture.
2:25:42 : This is not negotiable you're saying.
Yes, absolutely.
2:25:45 : It's not religion-based.
Absolutely.
2:25:47 : It's purely nation-based.
2:25:48 : That's the pride that you should have.
2:25:50 : These are things which
it's extremely important.
2:25:55 : As a country, they have one benefit is
that they fought for independence
2:25:59 : and they got independence.
2:26:00 : As a people, they are independent.
2:26:03 : They don't want to be
dependent on anybody.
2:26:05 : I gave you an example.
2:26:06 : My neighbour was an over-80-year-old man,
living alone.
2:26:10 : When I was mowing my lawn, because there,
as a community, when you live,
2:26:14 : you can't let the grass grow beyond.
2:26:15 : You have to keep it.
2:26:17 : I went to him and I offered to...
2:26:21 : He took offence at it.
2:26:23 : He says, Do you think I'm
incapable of cutting my lawn?
2:26:27 : An over-80, must be 83, 84-year-old man.
2:26:30 : And he cuts his lawn.
2:26:31 : He doesn't want help from anybody.
2:26:33 : So there is a strong sense of independence
that I'm not dependent on you.
2:26:37 : I can look after myself.
2:26:40 : So it has both pros.
2:26:41 : I'm not saying that everything is good
in that because family support,
2:26:44 : after all, is a strength.
2:26:46 : Emotional strength.
Emotional strength.
2:26:48 : But in their case, they pride themselves
on not having even wanting any
2:26:52 : support from anybody, near or far.
2:26:55 : The second thing is every house,
one, maybe because Because handymen are so
2:27:01 : expensive, everybody knows how to do minor
repairs in any, whether it be plumbing,
2:27:06 : electricity, woodwork.
2:27:08 : My brother-in-law does everything.
2:27:09 : He's got all the stuff there.
2:27:12 : But of course, they have tools
which allow you to do that.
2:27:14 : The power tools which are excellent.
Yeah, I agree.
2:27:17 : They have that.
2:27:18 : But they take pride
in their ability to do that.
2:27:21 : One last example I'll give you.
2:27:22 : Once my central AC had packed up.
2:27:25 : I spoke to the person I was
renting from, it's packed up.
2:27:28 : He said, Don't worry, I'll send somebody.
My friend is there.
2:27:30 : He runs a HVAC company.
I'll send him.
2:27:34 : This man who came to my house at 11:
00 at night was about 65 years old.
2:27:38 : He runs his own company.
2:27:40 : He comes in and he looks down and he says,
Okay, there is an issue with this part.
2:27:44 : I will change it.
2:27:44 : Then when he opens that unit, he says, I
think this requires a deep
2:27:49 : cleaning and servicing.
2:27:51 : It's at 11: 00 at night, imagine.
2:27:52 : He says, You go to sleep,
I'll finish it and I'll push.
2:27:55 : I said, No, I would like
to see what you're doing.
2:27:58 : For next two and a he talked me
through every action he was taking.
2:28:03 : See the passion he had
and the interest and pride he
2:28:08 : had in his ability to do that.
2:28:10 : A 65-year-old man.
At 11: 00 in the night.
2:28:12 : At 11: 00 at night.
2:28:13 : He finally finished
at about 2: 00 to 30: 00.
2:28:15 : But he had gone through and he
was as energetic as ever.
2:28:19 : He says, There.
2:28:20 : Now it is fit and it is good enough
to go for a number of more years.
2:28:24 : And that is it.
2:28:25 : That is the pride and ownership
if we get in our own functions.
2:28:31 : Then our standards automatically grow.
I think so.
2:28:33 : I think you have actually finished it very
well because what Major General Saab is
2:28:39 : saying is very clearly is
number one, nation first.
2:28:43 : And for that, you have to have the feel
and the pride of being a strong nation,
2:28:47 : flag hosting every day,
singing the national anthem every day as
2:28:50 : children, training them
on critical thinking skills.
2:28:53 : I mean, these are fundamental things
to produce better citizens who are better
2:28:57 : than the previous generation
to make it happen.
2:28:59 : Self help, living with the freedom.
2:29:02 : I think that's the way it is.
2:29:03 : I think you've got the message very,
very clearly.
2:29:05 : Hopefully.
2:29:05 : Thank you very much for such
a fantastic chat we had.
2:29:10 : No, it's a pleasure.
Thank you so much.
2:29:10 : I know.
I think I can.
2:29:11 : For giving me the time.
2:29:12 : At the end, the leadership, as what I say,
the leadership has to be a visionary
2:29:17 : cheerleader and a pit boss.
2:29:18 : I said it so many times,
you have to be on the ground.
2:29:20 : Absolutely.
Otherwise, it's not going to happen.
2:29:22 : Ladies and gentlemen,
as I wind up here, you have to understand
2:29:26 : one thing that you have to subscribe
to our channel, click the like button,
2:29:31 : share this video and everything else
that we have put on the channel,
2:29:35 : hit the like button, and the bell icon.

2:29:40 : You never know how it's going to help.
2:29:42 : For people like Major General Saab,
who has made such a big impact on our
2:29:46 : lives and people around us and protecting
us within his team, a major salute, sir.
2:29:52 : Thank you so much.
Thank you.
2:29:54 : Thank you for the time and giving me
an opportunity
2:29:56 : for reaching more than my family.
2:29:58 : My family gets tired of me I'm talking.
2:30:01 : I have got a larger audience
definitely for my family.
2:30:04 : I look forward to.
2:30:05 : I really enjoyed the opportunity.
2:30:06 : We are going to release this
video on Kargil Divas day.
2:30:10 : Oh, excellent.
2:30:10 : If you have any message that you want
to give to people, we would love
2:30:15 : to hear to the armed forces and others.
2:30:17 : First, of course, we are indebted
to people who sacrifice their lives.
2:30:22 : Ultimately, Kargill,
war or any war, for that matter,
2:30:25 : operations,
indicates individual sacrificing lives
2:30:29 : for the larger good of the community.
2:30:31 : For that, we are obligated
to them and to their families.
2:30:39 : I
take pride in the fact that I belong to
2:30:44 : an organisation
which contributes in this manner.
2:30:48 : It is not to say that any organisation can
contribute as long as
2:30:53 : it is towards the larger good.
2:30:55 : We are all looking to an industry
contributes by creating jobs.
2:30:59 : It is for a larger community.
2:31:01 : On Kargillivas, of course,
it's a famous victory.
2:31:04 : But yes, we remember the people
who lost their lives there.
2:31:07 : We remember the sacrifices made.
2:31:10 : We commemorated for a simple reason
that tomorrow, when an opportunity or
2:31:15 : an incident happens again,
people don't shy away because they
2:31:18 : know they are going to be remembered.
2:31:19 : That is extremely important that we
remember people who sacrifice
2:31:23 : whatever they sacrifice,
whether it be their lives, limbs.
2:31:27 : Absolutely.
2:31:28 : There are so many ways we show our
contribution.
2:31:33 : As long as we remember them,
then this gets perpetuated and people
2:31:38 : are more willing to participate.
2:31:40 : Absolutely.
2:31:40 : This commemoration, I think,
is extremely important.
2:31:43 : That's my last- Perfect.
2:31:45 : One thing I did forget to mention,
Major General Saab was
2:31:49 : got into Jemal and Kashmir five days
before the abrogation
2:31:53 : of Article 370 happened.
2:31:55 : You can imagine what that means.
2:31:56 : He was there for the next two years,
making sure after The effects
2:32:00 : of that has no civilian casualties.
2:32:02 : I think he and his team played
a fantastic role for that.
2:32:05 : They did an excellent job.
2:32:06 : Thank you very much for that.
Thank you, sir.
2:32:08 : We are indeed to follow you and your team.
2:32:10 : Pleasure very much
and thank you very much.
2:32:12 : Jaihin.
2:32:14 : Yeah, Jaihin.
Thank you.
2:32:15 : So, Maja Jhansab, the last action
is for me to give you a gift.
2:32:19 : We give all our guests this book, a book
written by us called Rebooting the Brain.
2:32:23 : Thank you so much.

2:32:24 : Please do give it.

2:32:40 : and so much other things on Rebooting
the Brain, please, Reboot your Brain.
2:33:07 : I have a sad story to tell about a young
18-year-old girl who was studying
2:33:13 : in an engineering college.
2:33:14 : First year, she had come
all the way down from Delhi.
2:33:17 : She came to the clinic, no, to a hospital
with her friends, parents not here.
2:33:24 : Leg pain, leg swelling,
not just the leg, including the thigh.
2:33:29 : She was in discomfort, she was in pain.
2:33:32 : So I said, When did this start?
2:33:37 : She says, I had to take some hormonal
pills to stop my periods
2:33:41 : because there was a puja.
2:33:43 : And
this is one of the conditions which causes
2:33:47 : a deep vein thrombosis,
one of the risk factors.
2:33:49 : Happens once in a while.
2:33:51 : And we got a scan done.
2:33:53 : The clot was almost till
the near level of umbilicals.
2:33:56 : That is the common iliac vein.
2:33:58 : And just for three days?
Three days.
2:34:01 : Of the tablets?
Crazy.
2:34:02 : Of the tablets.
Three days after the time.
2:34:03 : Then we told her as well as
2:34:08 : the friends, all young kids,
2:34:10 : teenage kids, first year of engineering.
2:34:13 : No, it's a serious
condition needs admission.
2:34:17 : They were not ready for admission.
2:34:21 : They said, No, we don't
want to get admitted.
2:34:24 : I said, Let me talk to the warden.
2:34:26 : Spoke to the warden.
2:34:29 : They said, No, we can't take a decision.
2:34:31 : The parents have to take a decision.
2:34:33 : So it was...
2:34:34 : I insisted on speaking to one of them
or any family member who's a doctor.
2:34:39 : So I ended up speaking to the father
itself, who educated person, well person.
2:34:45 : So I told him, It's very important
for us to admit her and treat her.
2:34:49 : So he said, Doc, mother is saying no.
2:34:54 : I'll be coming tomorrow morning,
and then we will meet you.
2:35:00 : Unfortunately, in the middle of the night,
I get a call at around 2: 00 AM saying
2:35:05 : that a young girl has been rushed
into the casualty emergency section,
2:35:10 : and she is not breathing.
2:35:12 : I felt so miserable.
2:35:15 : I thought I should have...
2:35:18 : Got them on the collar
and put them inside.
2:35:20 : Yeah, I should have done that.
2:35:21 : I spoke to them, but maybe my convincing
skills were not good enough.
2:35:25 : Called Jivas,
Jain Institute of Vascular Surgery.
2:35:30 : You just celebrated 25 years recently.
2:35:35 : Rather than me saying,
let's hear it from you,
2:35:38 : what is this that keeps this team buzzing?
2:35:41 : I see your whole team.
