Use the following instructions to generate clean, well-organized, and complete notes based on the transcript. The goal is to extract **every main topic covered** and break them down using a clear hierarchical structure with headings, subheadings, and bullet points.
The output that you return must be in markdown format

0)Title of the document
Begin with a title as "{Title}" as a level 1 heading with '#'

1)Title of the video
Directly under the heading write the title of the video as a level 2 heading with '##'

2)Link to video
The first line below the titles should be 'Link to video : {url}'

3)Index of topics
Add a section titled: `## Index of Topics Covered in the Notes`.  
List all main topics mentioned in the transcript.  
Number each topic clearly (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...).  
Each item should match the main headline sections below.
Use numbered bullets in markdown language for this.

4)Main Topics as Headings
Each main topic must be formatted as a level-three heading: `###`.
Headings must be short, clear, and informative

5)Subheadings for Subtopics
Use a level-four headings (`####`) under each main topic to give a short contextual intro labeled as `####1.0 Intro to Topic` `####2.0 Intro to Topic` etc.
This intro should contain a few points which can give context to the reader for the current heading. Ideally some background which points out how this heading is linked to the previous and the whole.
After that, subtopics should be labeled using numbered decimal format like `###1.1`, `###1.2`, `###2.1`, etc 

5)Subtopic Format
Each subtopic should used unordered lists (bullets) as its points with an indent of 2 spaces

Eg for Subtopic as a subheading with points:
#### 1.1 {Subtopic 1}
  - Point 1
  - Point 2
  .
  .
  .

5)Language and Style
Use neutral, objective, and concise language.  
Avoid complex sentences and jargon.  
Ensure every bullet clearly communicates a single fact or idea.
Maintain uniform spacing.

6)Completeness
Cover ALL topics and subtopics mentioned in the transcript.  
DO NOT OMMIT ANY points/headings/examples  
Maintain or LOGICAL flow of points and topics at all times such that the notes feels like the concepts flow from one point to the other
